| 34621978 | GenoRisk: A polygenic risk score for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.                                                                                                                                                           | Recent clinical trials are considering inclusion of more than just apolipoprotein E (APOE) Œµ4 genotype as a way of reducing variability in analysis of outcomes. Case-control data were used to compare the capacity of age, sex, and 58 Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to predict AD status using several statistical models. Model performance was assessed with Brier scores and tenfold cross-validation. Genotype and sex √ó age estimates from the best performing model were combined with age and intercept estimates from the general population to develop a personalized genetic risk score, termed age, and sex-adjusted GenoRisk. The elastic net model that included age, age x sex interaction, allelic APOE terms, and 29 additional SNPs performed the best. This model explained an additional 19% of the heritable risk compared to APOE genotype alone and achieved an area under the curve of 0.747. GenoRisk could improve the risk assessment of individuals identified for prevention studies. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

| 34562997 | Variables Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine Hesitancy Amongst Patients with Neurological Disorders.                                                                                                  | Given that the success of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies on herd immunity, identifying patients at risk for vaccine hesitancy is imperative-particularly for those at high risk for severe COVID-19 (i.e., minorities and patients with neurological disorders). Among patients from a large neuroscience institute in Hawaii, vaccine hesitancy was investigated in relation to over 30 sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities, via a telephone quality improvement survey conducted between 23 January 2021 and 13 February 2021. Vaccine willingness (n = 363) was 81.3%. Univariate analysis identified that the odds of vaccine acceptance reduced for patients who do not regard COVID-19 as a severe illness, are of younger age, have a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, use illicit drugs, or carry Medicaid insurance. Multivariable logistic regression identified the best predictors of vaccine hesitancy to be: social media use to obtain COVID-19 information, concerns regarding vaccine safety, self-perception of a preexisting medical condition contraindicated with vaccination, not having received the annual influenza vaccine, having some high school education only, being a current smoker, and not having a prior cerebrovascular accident. Unique amongst males, a conservative political view strongly predicted vaccine hesitancy. Specifically for Asians, a higher body mass index, while for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI), a positive depression screen, both reduced the odds of vaccine acceptance. Upon identifying the variables associated with vaccine hesitancy amongst patients with neurological disorders, our clinic is now able to efficiently provide ancillary COVID-19 education to sub-populations at risk for vaccine hesitancy. While our results may be limited to the sub-population of patients with neurological disorders, the findings nonetheless provide valuable insight to understanding vaccine hesitancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 34545941 | Cancer statistics for the US Hispanic/Latino population, 2021.                                                                                                                                                      | The Hispanic/Latino population is the second largest racial/ethnic group in the continental United States and Hawaii, accounting for 18% (60.6 million) of the total population. An additional 3 million Hispanic Americans live in Puerto Rico. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanic individuals in the United States using the most recent population-based data. An estimated 176,600 new cancer cases and 46,500 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanic individuals in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2021. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), Hispanic men and women had 25%-30% lower incidence (2014-2018) and mortality (2015-2019) rates for all cancers combined and lower rates for the most common cancers, although this gap is diminishing. For example, the colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rate ratio for Hispanic compared with NHW individuals narrowed from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.78) in 1995 to 0.91 (95% CI, 0.89-0.93) in 2018, reflecting delayed declines in CRC rates among Hispanic individuals in part because of slower uptake of screening. In contrast, Hispanic individuals have higher rates of infection-related cancers, including approximately two-fold higher incidence of liver and stomach cancer. Cervical cancer incidence is 32% higher among Hispanic women in the continental US and Hawaii and 78% higher among women in Puerto Rico compared to NHW women, yet is largely preventable through screening. Less access to care may be similarly reflected in the low prevalence of localized-stage breast cancer among Hispanic women, 59% versus 67% among NHW women. Evidence-based strategies for decreasing the cancer burden among the Hispanic population include the use of culturally appropriate lay health advisors and patient navigators and targeted, community-based intervention programs to facilitate access to screening and promote healthy behaviors. In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer trends and disparities in the Hispanic population should be closely monitored. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

| 34529634 | Disaggregating Data to Measure Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes and Guide Community Response - Hawaii, March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021.                                                                      | Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (1-3). Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian populations vary in language; cultural practices; and social, economic, and environmental experiences,‚Ä† which can affect health outcomes (4).¬ß However, data from these populations are often aggregated in analyses. Although data aggregation is often used as an approach to increase sample size and statistical power when analyzing data from smaller population groups, it can limit the understanding of disparities among diverse Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian subpopulations¬∂ (4-7). To assess disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian populations, a disaggregated, descriptive analysis, informed by recommendations from these communities,\*\* was performed using race data from 21,005 COVID-19 cases and 449 COVID-19-associated deaths reported to the Hawaii State Department of Health (HDOH) during March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021.‚Ä†‚Ä† In Hawaii, COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 population were 1,477 and 32, respectively during this period. In analyses with race categories that were not mutually exclusive, including persons of one race alone or in combination with one or more races, Pacific Islander persons, who account for 5% of Hawaii‚Äôs population, represented 22% of COVID-19 cases and deaths (COVID-19 incidence of 7,070 and mortality rate of 150). Native Hawaiian persons experienced an incidence of 1,181 and a mortality rate of 15. Among subcategories of Asian populations, the highest incidences were experienced by Filipino persons (1,247) and Vietnamese persons (1,200). Disaggregating Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian race data can aid in identifying racial disparities among specific subpopulations and highlights the importance of partnering with communities to develop culturally responsive outreach teams¬ß¬ß and tailored public health interventions and vaccination campaigns to more effectively address health disparities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 34499878 | Mass Critical Care Surge Response during COVID-19: Implementation of Contingency Strategies A Preliminary Report of findings from the Task Force for Mass Critical Care.                                            | Following the publication of 2014 consensus statement regarding mass critical care during public health emergencies, much has been learned about surge responses and the care of overwhelming numbers of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.1 Gaps in prior pandemic planning were identified and require modification in the midst of ongoing surge throughout the world. The Task Force for Mass Critical Care (TFMCC) adopted a modified version of established rapid guideline methodologies from the World Health Organization2 and the Guidelines International Network-McMaster Guideline Development Checklist.3 With a consensus development process incorporating expert opinion to define important questions and extract evidence, TFMCC developed relevant pandemic surge suggestions in a structured manner, incorporating peer-reviewed literature, ‚Äúgray‚Äù evidence from lay media sources, and anecdotal experiential evidence. Ten suggestions were identified regarding staffing, load-balancing, communication, and technology. Staffing models are suggested with resilience strategies to support critical care staff. Intensive care unit (ICU) surge strategies and strain indicators are suggested to enhance ICU prioritization tactics to maintain contingency level care and avoid crisis triage, with early transfer strategies to further load-balance care. We suggest intensivists and hospitalists be engaged with the incident command structure to ensure two-way communication, situational awareness, and the use of technology to support critical care delivery and families of patients in intensive care units (ICUs).

| 34491990 | Using test positivity and reported case rates to estimate state-level COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence in the United States.                                                                                  | Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses and vaccination coverage needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in each United States (U.S.) state. However, reliable, timely data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates are highly biased. A simple data-driven Bayesian semi-empirical modeling framework was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. The model was calibrated to and validated using published state-wide seroprevalence data, and further compared against two independent data-driven mathematical models. The prevalence of undiagnosed COVID-19 infections is found to be well-approximated by a geometrically weighted average of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. Our model accurately fits state-level seroprevalence data from across the U.S. Prevalence estimates of our semi-empirical model compare favorably to those from two data-driven epidemiological models. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% \[Credible Interval (CrI): 1.0%-1.9%\] and a seroprevalence of 13.2% \[CrI: 12.3%-14.2%\], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.2% \[CrI: 0.1%-0.3%\] in Hawaii to 2.8% \[CrI: 1.8%-4.1%\] in Tennessee, and seroprevalence from 1.5% \[CrI: 1.2%-2.0%\] in Vermont to 23% \[CrI: 20%-28%\] in New York. Cumulatively, reported cases correspond to only one third of actual infections. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate approach to estimating COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 34481278 | The challenge of COVID-19 for adult men and women in the United States: disparities of psychological distress by gender and age.                                                                                    | During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of psychological distress rose from 11% in 2019 to more than 40% in 2020. This study aims to examine the disparities among US adult men and women. We used 21 waves of cross-sectional data from the Household Pulse Survey that were collected between April and December 2020 for the study. The Household Pulse Survey was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to document the social and economic impact of COVID-19. The study population included four groups of adults: emerging adults (18-24 years); young adults (25-44 years); middle-aged adults (45-64 years); and older adults (65-88 years). Psychological distress was measured by their Generalized Anxiety Disorder score and the Patient Health Questionnaire. The prevalence of psychological stress was calculated using logistic models adjusted for socio-demographic variables including race/ethnicity, education, household income, and household structure. All descriptive and regression analysis considered survey weights. Younger age groups experienced higher prevalence of psychological distress than older age groups. Among emerging adults, the prevalence of anxiety (42.6%) and depression (39.5%) was more than twice as high as older adults who experienced prevalence of anxiety at 20% and depression at 16.6%. Gender differences were also more apparent in emerging adults. Women between 18 and 24 years reported higher differential rates of anxiety and depression than those with men (anxiety: 43.9% vs.¬†28.3%; depression: 33.3% vs.¬†24.9%). Understanding the complex dynamics between COVID-19 and psychological distress has emerged as a public health priority. Mitigating the negative mental health consequences associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, for younger generations and females in particular, will require local efforts to rebuild capacity for social integration and social connection.

Seroprevalence was weighted for demographic differences between the blood donor sample and general population. Infection-induced seroprevalence was defined as the prevalence of the population with both spike and nucleocapsid antibodies. Combined infection- and vaccination-induced seroprevalence was defined as the prevalence of the population with spike antibodies. The seroprevalence estimates were compared with cumulative COVID-19 case report incidence rates. Among 1 443 519 specimens included, 733 052 (50.8%) were from women, 174 842 (12.1%) were from persons aged 16 to 29 years, 292 258 (20.2%) were from persons aged 65 years and older, 36 654 (2.5%) were from non-Hispanic Black persons, and 88 773 (6.1%) were from Hispanic persons. The overall infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimate increased from 3.5% (95% CI, 3.2%-3.8%) in July 2020 to 20.2% (95% CI, 19.9%-20.6%) in May 2021; the combined infection- and vaccination-induced seroprevalence estimate in May 2021 was 83.3% (95% CI, 82.9%-83.7%). By May 2021, 2.1 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% CI, 2.0-2.1) per reported COVID-19 case were estimated to have occurred. Based on a sample of blood donations in the US from July 2020 through May 2021, vaccine- and infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence increased over time and varied by age, race and ethnicity, and geographic region. Despite weighting to adjust for demographic differences, these findings from a national sample of blood donors may not be representative of the entire US population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We reviewed 13-Feb-2020 through 15-Apr-2021 National Poison Data System (NPDS) COVID-19 records for changes over time. We examined NPDS cases and VAERS COVID-19 vaccine reports 1-Nov-2020 through 2-Apr-2021 for vaccine manufacturer, patient characteristics, state, and clinical effects. PCs reported 1,052,174 COVID-19 contacts; maximum (peak) contacts/day (12,163) on 16-Mar-2020. As of 5-Apr-2021 the US reported &gt;167 million administrations of COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Janssen). US PCs reported 162,052 COVID-19 vaccine contacts. Most (61.1%) were medical information calls, 34.9% were drug information, and 2.58% were exposures. Over the same period VAERS reported 49,078 COVID-19 vaccine cases reporting 226,205 symptoms - headache most frequent, ranging from 20% to 40% across the 3 vaccines. Although differences exist between the intent and content of the 2 data sets, NPDS volume is compelling. The PC nationwide 800 number facilitates data collection and suggests comingling the 2 data streams has merit. PC professionals received tens of thousands of calls and can: 1) support fact-based vaccine information; 2) contribute vaccine AE follow-up information: 3) advocate for best-case coding and reporting, especially for vaccine adverse experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Here, we review the role of epidemiological models in understanding evolving epidemic characteristics, including the effects of vaccination and Variants of Concern (VoC). We highlight ways in which models continue to provide important insights, including (1) calculating the herd immunity threshold and evaluating its limitations; (2) verifying that nascent vaccines can prevent severe disease, infection, and transmission but may be less efficacious against VoC; (3) determining optimal vaccine allocation strategies under efficacy and supply constraints; and (4) determining that VoC are more transmissible and lethal than previously circulating strains, and that immune escape may jeopardize vaccine-induced herd immunity. Finally, we explore how models can help us anticipate and prepare for future stages of COVID-19 epidemiology (and that of other diseases) through forecasts and scenario projections, given current uncertainties and data limitations.

| 34406840 | Vaccinations Against COVID-19 May Have Averted Up To 140,000 Deaths In The United States.                                                                                                                           | COVID-19 vaccination campaigns continue in the United States, with the expectation that vaccines will slow transmission of the virus, save lives, and enable a return to normal life in due course. However, the extent to which faster vaccine administration has affected COVID-19-related deaths is unknown. We assessed the association between US state-level vaccination rates and COVID-19 deaths during the first five months of vaccine availability. We estimated that by May 9, 2021, the US vaccination campaign was associated with a reduction of 139,393 COVID-19 deaths. The association varied in different states. In New York, for example, vaccinations led to an estimated 11.7 fewer COVID-19 deaths per 10,000, whereas Hawaii observed the smallest reduction, with an estimated 1.1 fewer deaths per 10,000. Overall, our analysis suggests that the early COVID-19 vaccination campaign was associated with reductions in COVID-19 deaths. As of May 9, 2021, reductions in COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccines had translated to value of statistical life benefit ranging between $625 billion and $1.4 trillion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 34391908 | Impact of the World Antimicrobial Awareness Week on public interest between 2015 and 2020: A Google Trends analysis.                                                                                                | To evaluate the impact of the World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW) on public awareness of antimicrobial resistance using Google Trends analysis. The impact of WAAW on public awareness of ‚Äòantimicrobial resistance‚Äô (AMR), ‚Äòantibacterial‚Äô, and ‚Äòantibiotics‚Äô in Japan, the UK, the United States, and worldwide from 2015 to 2020 was analyzed, using the relative search volume (RSV) of Google Trends as a surrogate. A joinpoint regression analysis was performed to identify a statistically significant time point of a change in trend. No joinpoints around WAAW were identified in Japan, the United Kingdom, or the United States from 2015 to 2020 with RSVs of ‚ÄòAMR‚Äô, whereas increasing RSVs were noted worldwide in 2017 and 2020. Further, there were decreasing RSVs of ‚Äòantibiotics‚Äô in the first half of 2020, which could be due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study results suggest that WAAW did little to improve public awareness of AMR in the selected countries despite its contribution worldwide. This study implies that we need to develop a more effective method to improve public awareness to fight against AMR. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

| 34367726 | Predicting the Severity of Disease Progression in COVID-19 at the Individual and Population Level: A Mathematical Model.                                                                                            | The impact of COVID-19 disease on health and economy has been global, and the magnitude of devastation is unparalleled in modern history. Any potential course of action to manage this complex disease requires the systematic and efficient analysis of data that can delineate the underlying pathogenesis. We have developed a mathematical model of disease progression to predict the clinical outcome, utilizing a set of causal factors known to contribute to COVID-19 pathology such as age, comorbidities, and certain viral and immunological parameters. Viral load and selected indicators of a dysfunctional immune response, such as cytokines IL-6 and IFNŒ± which contribute to the cytokine storm and fever, parameters of inflammation D-Dimer and Ferritin, aberrations in lymphocyte number, lymphopenia, and neutralizing antibodies were included for the analysis. The model provides a framework to unravel the multi-factorial complexities of the immune response manifested in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Further, this model can be valuable to predict clinical outcome at an individual level, and to develop strategies for allocating appropriate resources to manage severe cases at a population level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 34355196 | Medical School Hotline: Immunoepigenetic-Microbiome Axis: Implications for Health Disparities Research in Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.                                                                   | Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations suffer from disproportionately higher rates of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, that arises from metabolic dysfunction and are often associated with obesity and inflammation. In addition, the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further compounded the effect of health inequities observed in Indigenous populations, including NHPI communities. Reversible lifestyle habits, such as diet, may either be protective of or contribute to the increasing prevalence of health inequities in these populations via the immunoepigenetic-microbiome axis. This axis offers insight into the connection between diet, epigenetics, the microbiome composition, immune function, and response to viral infection. Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate inflammatory states associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes, are impacted by diet. Furthermore, diet may modulate the gut microbiome by influencing microbial diversity and richness; dysbiosis of the microbiome is associated with chronic disease. A high fiber diet facilitates a favorable microbiome composition and in turn increases production of intermediate metabolites named short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that act on metabolic and immune pathways. In contrast, low fiber diets typically associated with a westernized lifestyle decreases the abundance of microbial derived SCFAs. This decreased abundance is characteristic of metabolic syndromes and activation of chronic inflammatory states, having larger implications in disease pathogenesis of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders that once thrived on healthy traditional diets may be more sensitive than non-indigenous peoples to the metabolic perturbation of westernized diets that impinge on the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis. Recent studies conducted in the Maunakea lab at the University of Hawai‚Äôi at MƒÅnoa John A. Burns School of Medicine have helped elucidate the connections between diet, microbiome composition, metabolic syndrome, and epigenetic regulation of immune function to better understand disease pathogenesis. Potentially, this research could point to ways to prevent pre-disease conditions through novel biomarker discovery using community-based approaches. ¬©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‚Äòi (UHP Hawai‚Äòi).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 34352507 | Trends in psychological distress and COVID-19 incidence across 15 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas in 2020.                                                                                                      | The United States experienced three surges of COVID-19 community infection since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on March 11, 2020. The prevalence of psychological distress among U.S. adults increased from 11 % in 2019 to 35.9 % in April 2020 when New York City become the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyzing 21 waves of the Household Pulse Survey data collected between April 2020 and December 2020, this study aimed to examine the distress level in the 15 most populated metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our study found that, as the pandemic swept from East to South and soared in the West, 39.9%-52.3 % U.S. adults living in these 15 metropolitan areas reported symptoms of psychological distress. The highest distress levels were found within the Western areas including Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario (52.3 % in July 2020, 95 % CI: 44.9%-59.6 %) and Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim (49.9 % in December 2020, 95 % CI: 44.5%-55.4 %). The lowest distress level was observed in Washington-Arlington-Alexandria ranging from 29.1 % in May 2020 to 39.9 % in November 2020. COVID-19 and its complex ecology of social and economic stressors have engaged high levels of sustained psychological distress. Our findings will support the efforts of local, state and national leadership to plan interventions by addressing not only the medical, but also the economic and social conditions associated with the pandemic.

| 34334985 | The effect of a statewide COVID-19 shelter-in-place order on shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humerus fracture volume and length of stay.                                                                         | Although the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted elective shoulder arthroplasty throughput, traumatic shoulder arthroplasty procedures are less apt to be postponed. We sought to evaluate shoulder arthroplasty utilization for fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic and California‚Äôs associated shelter-in-place order compared to historical controls. We conducted a cohort study with historical controls, identifying patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humerus fracture in California using our integrated electronic health record. The time period of interest was following the implementation of the statewide shelter-in-place order: March 19, 2020-May 31, 2020. This was compared to three historical periods: January 1, 2020-March 18, 2020, March 18, 2019-May 31, 2019, and January 1, 2019-March 18, 2019. Procedure volume, patient characteristics, in-hospital length of stay, and 30-day events (emergency department visit, readmission, infection, pneumonia, and death) were reported. Changes over time were analyzed using linear regression adjusted for usual seasonal and yearly changes and age, sex, comorbidities, and postadmission factors. Surgical volume dropped from an average of 4.4, 5.2, and 2.6 surgeries per week in the historical time periods, respectively, to 2.4 surgeries per week after shelter-in-place. While no more than 30% of all shoulder arthroplasty procedures performed during any given week were for fracture during the historical time periods, arthroplasties performed for fracture was the overwhelming primary indication immediately after the shelter-in-place order. More patients were discharged the day of surgery (+33.2%, P = .019) after the shelter-in-place order, but we did not observe a change in any of the corresponding 30-day events. The volume of shoulder arthroplasty for fracture dropped during the time of COVID-19. The reduction in volume could be due to less shoulder trauma due to shelter-in-place or a change in the indications for arthroplasty given the perceived higher risks associated with intubation and surgical care. We noted more patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty for fracture were safely discharged on the day of surgery, suggesting this may be a safe practice that can be adopted moving forward.

However, NHPI risks are overlooked in policy discussions. We discuss the NHPI COVID-19 Data Policy Lab and dashboard, featuring the disproportionate COVID-19 mortality burden for NHPIs. The Lab democratized NHPI data, developed community infrastructure and resources, and informed testing site and outreach policies related to health equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34308400 | Understanding COVID-19 dynamics and the effects of interventions in the Philippines: A mathematical modelling study.                                                                                                | COVID-19 initially caused less severe outbreaks in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared with many high-income countries, possibly because of differing demographics, socioeconomics, surveillance, and policy responses. Here, we investigate the role of multiple factors on COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines, a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak. We applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a ‚ÄúMinimum Health Standards‚Äù policy, MHS) to represent the first wave of the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and interventions. Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 13-27%. The February 2021 case detection rate was estimated at \~8%, population recovered at \~9%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence. COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, mobility, and MHS adherence. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS should help the Philippines control the epidemic until vaccines are widely distributed, but disease resurgence may be occurring due to a combination of low population immunity and detection rates and new variants of concern. ¬© 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

We performed a cross-sectional analysis nested within a prospective cohort of 2,102,364 participants from March 29, 2020 in the United States (US) and March 24, 2020 in the United Kingdom (UK) through December 02, 2020 via the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application. We examined the contribution of community-level deprivation using the Neighborhood Deprivation Index (NDI) and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) to observe racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 incidence. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04331509. Compared with non-Hispanic White participants, the risk for a positive COVID-19 test was increased in the US for non-Hispanic Black (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio \[OR\], 1.32; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 1.18-1.47) and Hispanic participants (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.33-1.52) and in the UK for Black (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.34), South Asian (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.30-1.49), and Middle Eastern participants (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18-1.61). This elevated risk was associated with living in more deprived communities according to the NDI/IMD. After accounting for downstream mediators of COVID-19 risk, community-level deprivation still mediated 16.6% and 7.7% of the excess risk in Black compared to White participants in the US and the UK, respectively. Our results illustrate the critical role of social determinants of health in the disproportionate COVID-19 risk experienced by racial and ethnic minorities. ¬© 2021 The Author(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 34291832 | The Impact of COVID-19 on Psychotherapy Participation Among Individuals With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Enrolled in Treatment Research.                                                                          | The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of daily life and required a rapid and unprecedented shift in psychotherapy delivery from in-person to telemental health. In the present study, we explored the impact of the pandemic on individuals‚Äô ability to participate in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) psychotherapy and the association between the impact of COVID-19 impact on health and financial well-being and psychotherapy participation. Participants (N = 161, 63.2% male, Mage = 42.7 years) were United States military veterans (n = 108), active duty military personnel (n = 12), and civilians (n = 6), who were participating in one of nine PTSD treatment trials. The results indicate a predominately negative COVID-19 impact on therapy participation, although some participants (26.1%) found attending therapy sessions through telehealth to be easier than in-person therapy. Most participants (66.7%) reported that completing in vivo exposure homework became harder during the pandemic.

| 34283939 | A National Pediatric Telepsychiatry Curriculum for Graduate Medical Education and Continuing Medical Education.                                                                                                     | Objectives: Our goal was to develop an open access nationally disseminated online curriculum for use in graduate and continuing medical education on the topic of pediatric telepsychiatry to enhance the uptake of telepsychiatry among child psychiatry training programs and improve access to mental health care for youth and families. Methods: Following Kern‚Äôs 6-stage model of curriculum development, we identified a core problem, conducted a needs assessment, developed broad goals and measurable objectives in a competency-based model, and developed educational content and methods. The curriculum was reviewed by experts and feedback incorporated. Given the urgent need for such a curriculum due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the curriculum was immediately posted on the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training websites. Further evaluation will be conducted over the next year. Results: The curriculum covers the six areas of core competence adapted for pediatric telepsychiatry and includes teaching content and resources, evaluation tools, and information about other resources. Conclusion: This online curriculum is available online and provides an important resource and set of standards for pediatric telepsychiatry training. Its online format allows for ongoing revision as the telepsychiatry landscape changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In December 2020, nurses in Hawaii were recruited for an online survey that measured perceived risk/threat of COVID-19, vaccine attitudes, and perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as level of intention: primary, secondary (i.e., delayed), or no intention to vaccinate. The final sample consisted of 423 nurses. Participants were primarily Asian (27.9%) and White (45.2%). The majority were 18-50 years (65.5%) and female (87.0%), held an RN license (91.7%), and identified as a staff nurse (57.7%) in the hospital setting (56.7%). Among participants, 52.3% indicated primary intention, 27.9% secondary intention, and 19.9% no intention to vaccinate. The strongest predictors of any level of intention were greater positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination and lower concerns related to COVID-19 vaccine safety. Findings can guide interventions to support vaccine acceptance for those who initially decline vaccination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34228774 | Association Between Administration of IL-6 Antagonists and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Meta-analysis.                                                                                     | Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of IL-6 antagonists in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have variously reported benefit, no effect, and harm. To estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes. Trials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts. Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria. In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days. A total of 10 930 patients (median age, 61 years \[range of medians, 52-68 years\]; 3560 \[33%\] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 \[95% CI, 0.79-0.95\]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P &lt; .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16). In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.

The model is simulated using data relevant to the dynamics of the diseases in Lagos, Nigeria, making predictions for the attainment of peak periods in the presence or absence of comorbidity. The model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation caused by the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles as well as the rate of reinfection by those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Simulations of the cumulative number of active cases (including those with comorbidity), at different reinfection rates, show infection peaks reducing with decreasing reinfection of those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. In addition, optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model reveal that the strategy that prevents COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles is the most cost-effective of all the control strategies for the prevention of COVID-19. ¬© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 34210370 | Estimation of delay-adjusted all-cause excess mortality in the USA: March-December 2020.                                                                                                                            | We estimate the delay-adjusted all-cause excess deaths across 53 US jurisdictions. Using provisional data collected from September through December 2020, we first identify a common mean reporting delay of 2.8 weeks, whereas four jurisdictions have prolonged reporting delays compared to the others: Connecticut (mean 5.8 weeks), North Carolina (mean 10.4 weeks), Puerto Rico (mean 4.7 weeks) and West Virginia (mean 5.5 weeks). After adjusting for reporting delays, we estimate the percent change in all-cause excess mortality from March to December 2020 with range from 0.2 to 3.6 in Hawaii to 58.4 to 62.4 in New York City. Comparing the March-December with September-December 2020 periods, the highest increases in excess mortality are observed in South Dakota (36.9-54.0), North Dakota (33.9-50.7) and Missouri (27.8-33.9). Our findings indicate that analysis of provisional data requires caution in interpreting the death counts in recent weeks, while one needs also to account for heterogeneity in reporting delays of excess deaths among US jurisdictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 34195618 | Rapid Implementation of a Statewide Observational Surveillance System to Monitor Wearing of Face Masks in Public Spaces.                                                                                            | This report describes the rapid implementation of a statewide observational surveillance program to monitor the public‚Äôs wearing of face masks in public spaces during community spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It describes how the Hawai‚Äôi State Department of Health partnered with University of Hawai‚Äôi faculty to develop and implement the surveillance program. The surveillance program involved organizing volunteers to conduct weekly direct observations in designated locations. A smartphone application (app) was created to record real-time observational surveillance data. From September 5, 2020, to March 13, 2021, a total of 84 577 observations were conducted across the state. Eighty-three percent of those observed were correctly wearing a face mask, 7% were wearing a face mask incorrectly, and 10% were not wearing a mask. Following the 2-week pilot phase of the project, volunteers were surveyed regarding facilitators and barriers for conducting observations and motivations for volunteering. Feedback was used to refine project procedures. With few states having implemented such a surveillance program, the information reported in this article may inform communities interested in tracking mask-wearing behaviors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. ¬©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‚Äòi (UHP Hawai‚Äòi).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 34189029 | The information-seeking behavior and levels of knowledge, precaution, and fear of college students in Iloilo, Philippines amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                             | COVID-19 pandemic is devastating the health, social, and economic well-being of citizens worldwide. The high rates of morbidity and mortality and the absence of vaccines cause fear among the people regardless of age, gender, or social status. People‚Äôs fear is heightened by misinformation spread across all media types, especially on social media. Filipino college students are one of the top Internet users worldwide and are very active in social media. Hence they are very prone to misinformation. This paper aims to ascertain the levels of knowledge, precaution, and fear of COVID-19 of the college students in Iloilo, Philippines, and determine the effects of their information-seeking behavior on the variables above. This paper is a cross-sectional survey that used a qualitative-quantitative method and snowball sampling technique. Data were gathered among 228 college students using an online survey instrument a few months after the pandemic began. College students were knowledgeable of the basic facts about the highly infectious COVID-19. However, the majority were inclined to believe the myths and misinformation regarding the pandemic. Television was the primary, most believable, and preferred source when seeking information. The Internet as a preferred source of information was significantly associated with a high level of knowledge. In contrast, the information sourced from interpersonal channels were found to make college students very cautious. The local presence of COVID-19 cases had caused college students to fear, likely exacerbated by the plethora of information about the pandemic, mostly from Facebook. This is the first study conducted on the effects of the information-seeking behavior on the levels of knowledge, precaution, and fear of COVID-19 of the college students in Iloilo, Philippines. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.¬†All rights reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 34183789 | An integrative multiomics analysis identifies putative causal genes for COVID-19 severity.                                                                                                                          | It is critical to identify putative causal targets for SARS coronavirus 2, which may guide drug repurposing options to reduce the public health burden of COVID-19. We applied complementary methods and multiphased design to pinpoint the most likely causal genes for COVID-19 severity. First, we applied cross-methylome omnibus (CMO) test and leveraged data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) comparing 9,986 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 1,877,672 population controls. Second, we evaluated associations using the complementary S-PrediXcan method and leveraging blood and lung tissue gene expression prediction models. Third, we assessed associations of the identified genes with another COVID-19 phenotype, comparing very severe respiratory confirmed COVID versus population controls. Finally, we applied a fine-mapping method, fine-mapping of gene sets (FOGS), to prioritize putative causal genes. Through analyses of the COVID-19 HGI using complementary CMO and S-PrediXcan methods along with fine-mapping, XCR1, CCR2, SACM1L, OAS3, NSF, WNT3, NAPSA, and IFNAR2 are identified as putative causal genes for COVID-19 severity. We identified eight genes at five genomic loci as putative causal genes for COVID-19 severity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34183411 | Epidemics and the future of coffee production.                                                                                                                                                                      | In this perspective, we draw on recent scientific research on the coffee leaf rust (CLR) epidemic that severely impacted several countries across Latin America and the Caribbean over the last decade, to explore how the socioeconomic impacts from COVID-19 could lead to the reemergence of another rust epidemic. We describe how past CLR outbreaks have been linked to reduced crop care and investment in coffee farms, as evidenced in the years following the 2008 global financial crisis. We discuss relationships between CLR incidence, farmer-scale agricultural practices, and economic signals transferred through global and local effects. We contextualize how current COVID-19 impacts on labor, unemployment, stay-at-home orders, and international border policies could affect farmer investments in coffee plants and in turn create conditions favorable for future shocks. We conclude by arguing that COVID-19‚Äôs socioeconomic disruptions are likely to drive the coffee industry into another severe production crisis. While this argument illustrates the vulnerabilities that come from a globalized coffee system, it also highlights the necessity of ensuring the well-being of all. By increasing investments in coffee institutions and paying smallholders more, we can create a fairer and healthier system that is more resilient to future social-ecological shocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 34183191 | Undergraduate nursing students‚Äô perceptions on nursing education during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic: A national sample.                                                                                              | In 2020, nursing educational programs were abruptly interrupted and largely moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To explore nursing students‚Äô perspectives about the effects of the pandemic on their education and intention to join the nursing workforce. Undergraduate nursing students from 5 universities across 5 United States regions were invited to participate in an online survey to elicit both quantitative and qualitative data. The final sample included quantitative data on 772 students and qualitative data on 540 students. Largely (65.1%), students reported that the pandemic strengthened their desire to become a nurse; only 11% had considered withdrawing from school.

| 34140009 | Structural inequities in seasonal influenza vaccination rates.                                                                                                                                                      | Influenza immunization is a highly effective method of reducing illness, hospitalization and mortality from this disease. However, influenza vaccination rates in the U.S. remain below public health targets and persistent structural inequities reduce the likelihood that Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Latina/o, Asian groups, and populations of low socioeconomic status will receive the influenza vaccine. We analyzed correlates of influenza vaccination rates using the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in the year 2020. Our analysis compared influenza vaccination as the outcome of interest with the variables age, sex, race, education, income, geographic location, health insurance status, access to primary care, history of delaying care due to cost, and comorbidities such as: asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, body mass index, cancer and diabetes. Non-Hispanic White (46.5%) and Asian (44.1%) participants are more likely to receive the influenza vaccine compared to Non-Hispanic Black (36.7%), Hispanic (33.9%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (36.6%), and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (37.9%) participants. We found persistent structural inequities that predict influenza vaccination, within and across racial and ethnic groups, including not having health insurance \[OR: 0.51 (0.47-0.55)\], not having regular access to primary care \[OR: 0.50 (0.48-0.52)\], and the need to delay medical care due to cost \[OR: 0.75 (0.71-0.79)\]. As COVID-19 vaccination efforts evolve, it is important for physicians and policymakers to identify the structural impediments to equitable U.S. influenza vaccination so that future vaccination campaigns are not impeded by these barriers to immunization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 34125658 | Rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 sub-lineage in the United States of America with spike protein D178H and membrane protein V70L mutations.                                                                       | The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage is highly infectious and as of April 2021 accounted for 92% of COVID-19 cases in Europe and 59% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. It is defined by the N501Y mutation in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein, and a few other mutations. These include two mutations in the N terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, HV69-70del and Y144del (also known as Y145del due to the presence of tyrosine at both positions). We recently identified several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns, characterized by Membrane (M) protein mutations, including I82T and V70L. We now identify a sub-lineage of B.1.1.7 that emerged through sequential acquisitions of M:V70L in November 2020 followed by a novel S:D178H mutation first observed in early February 2021. The percentage of B.1.1.7 isolates in the US that belong to this sub-lineage increased from 0.15% in February 2021 to 1.8% in April 2021. To date, this sub-lineage appears to be U.S.-specific with reported cases in 31 states, including Hawaii. As of April 2021, it constituted 36.8% of all B.1.1.7 isolates in Washington. Phylogenetic analysis and transmission inference with Nextstrain suggest this sub-lineage likely originated in either California or Washington. Structural analysis revealed that the S:D178H mutation is in the NTD of the S protein and close to two other signature mutations of B.1.1.7, HV69-70del and Y144del. It is surface exposed and may alter NTD tertiary configuration or accessibility, and thus has the potential to affect neutralization by NTD directed antibodies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 34108898 | Problematic Use of Internet-Related Activities and Perceived Weight Stigma in Schoolchildren: A Longitudinal Study Across Different Epidemic Periods of COVID-19 in China.                                          | Background: Social distancing and school suspension due to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) may have a negative impact on children‚Äôs behavior and well-being. Problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic social media use (PSMU) and perceived weight stigma (PWS) are particularly important issues for children, yet we have a poor understanding of how these may have been affected by lockdowns and physical isolation resulting from COVID-19. This research aimed to understand how these psychosocial and behavioral variables may be associated with psychological distress, and how these associations may have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 489 children completed a three-wave longitudinal study from January 2020 to June 2020. The first wave was conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak. The second wave was conducted during the outbreak. The third wave was conducted during post-COVID-19 lockdown. Questionnaires measured psychological distress, PSU, PSMU, and PWS. Results: PSU, PSMU, PWS and psychological distress were all significantly associated with each other. PSU was significantly higher during outbreak. PWS was significantly higher before outbreak. We found an increased association between PSMU and PWS across three waves in all three models. The association between PSU and depression/anxiety decreased across three waves; however, association between PSMU and depression/anxiety increased across three waves. Conclusions: COVID-19 initiated school suspension and associated lockdowns appear to have exacerbated PSU and depression among children. However, PWS was reduced during this period.

| 34102878 | Telehealth amid the COVID-19 pandemic: perception among Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander cancer patients.                                                                                                | Aim: To assess the perception of telehealth visits among a multiracial cancer population during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at outpatient cancer clinics in Hawaii between March and August 2020. Patients were invited to participate in the survey either by phone or email. Results: Of the 212 survey respondents, 61.3% were Asian, 23.6% were White and 15.1% were Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders. Asians, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders were less likely to desire future telehealth visits compared with Whites. Predictors with regard to preferring future telehealth visits included lower income and hematopoietic cancers. Conclusion: The authors found racial differences in preference for telehealth. Future studies aimed at overcoming these racial disparities are needed to provide equitable oncology care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 34091576 | Investigating the Impact of Job Loss and Decreased Work Hours on Physical and Mental Health Outcomes Among US Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic.                                                                  | To investigate associations between adverse changes in employment status and physical and mental health among US adults (aged 18 years or older) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from participants (N = 2565) of a national Internet panel (June 2020) were assessed using path analyses to test associations between changes in self-reported employment status and hours worked and physical and mental health outcomes. Respondents who lost a job after March 1, 2020 (vs those who did not) reported more than twice the number of mentally unhealthy days. Females and those lacking social support had significantly worse physical and mental health outcomes.

| 34062806 | Time Trends in Racial/Ethnic Differences in COVID-19 Infection and Mortality.                                                                                                                                       | Studies documenting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) racial/ethnic disparities in the United States were limited to data from the initial few months of the pandemic, did not account for changes over time, and focused primarily on Black and Hispanic minority groups. To fill these gaps, we examined time trends in racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection and mortality. We used the Veteran Health Administration‚Äôs (VHA) national database of veteran COVID-19 infections over three time periods: 3/1/2020-5/31/2020 (spring); 6/1/2020-8/31/2020 (summer); and 9/1/2020-11/25/2020 (fall). We calculated COVID-19 infection and mortality predicted probabilities from logistic regression models that included time period-by-race/ethnicity interaction terms, and controlled for age, gender, and prior diagnosis of CDC risk factors. Racial/ethnic groups at higher risk for COVID-19 infection and mortality changed over time. American Indian/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN), Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders experienced higher COVID-19 infections compared to Whites during the summertime. There were mortality disparities for Blacks in springtime, and AI/ANs, Asians, and Hispanics in summertime. Policy makers should consider the dynamic nature of racial/ethnic disparities as the pandemic evolves, and potential effects of risk mitigation and other (e.g., economic) policies on these disparities. Researchers should consider how trends in disparities change over time in other samples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 33980567 | Delayed, transient and self-resolving neutropenia following COVID-19 pneumonia.                                                                                                                                     | A novel coronaravirus, identified as SARS-CoV-2, spread throughout the world in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many discoveries and clinical manifestations. A young patient is presented with new, self-resolving neutropenia presenting weeks after a prolonged hospital stay for COVID-19 pneumonia. Workup included analysis for underlying infection, nutritional abnormalities, malignancy, medication and toxin exposure, all of which were negative. From 2020 to the present, few reports have described neutropenia associated with a recent COVID-19 infection. In particular, no reports have described a delayed presentation of neutropenia. The authors would like to propose that the significant inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 is likely what led to this patient‚Äôs postviral neutropenia. Furthermore, in young healthy patients, bone marrow biopsy may be deferred and a watchful-waiting approach may be taken to assess for neutropenia resolution. ¬© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

| 33973241 | Five Years and Moving Forward: A Successful Joint Academic-Practice Public Partnership to Improve the Health of Hawaii‚Äôs Schoolchildren.                                                                            | In 2014, the Hawaii Department of Education (DOE), the only statewide school system in the United States, predominately enrolled children (keiki) from underserved communities and lacked school nurses or a school health program. Chronic absenteeism due to health concerns was identified as a barrier to academic success. The DOE and a public university created Hawaii Keiki: Healthy and Ready to Learn (HK), a program to provide school-based services for 170 Title 1 schools in urban and rural settings and build momentum for statewide collective action. HK has maintained support from public and private entities to address student health. This paper describes 5 years of program development, implementation, and continuing challenges. Most recently in 2020-2021, HK pivoted in the face of school campus closings due to COVID-19 with strategic plans, including telehealth, to move forward in this changed school environment. The HK program has increased awareness of students‚Äô needs and is addressing the imperative to build health services within public schools. The multipronged approach of building awareness of need, providing direct services, educating future care providers, and supporting sound policy development, has an impact that goes beyond any one individual area. ¬© 2021 American School Health Association.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 33971389 | Face masks against COVID-19: Standards, efficacy, testing and decontamination methods.                                                                                                                              | Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic on a scale not seen for over a century. Increasing evidence suggests that respiratory droplets and aerosols are likely the most common route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. Since the virus can be spread by presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, universal face masking has been recommended as a straightforward and low-cost strategy to mitigate virus transmission. Numerous governments and public health agencies around the world have advocated for or mandated the wearing of masks in public settings, especially in situations where social distancing is not possible. However, the efficacy of wearing a mask remains controversial. This interdisciplinary review summarizes the current, state-of-the-art understanding of mask usage against COVID-19. It covers three main aspects of mask usage amid the pandemic: quality standards for various face masks and their fundamental filtration mechanisms, empirical methods for quantitatively determining mask integrity and particle filtration efficiency, and decontamination methods that allow for the reuse of traditionally disposable N95 and surgical masks. The focus is given to the fundamental physicochemical and engineering sciences behind each aspect covered in this review, providing novel insights into the current understanding of mask usage to curb COVID-19 spread.

| 33929934 | A real-time and high-throughput neutralization test based on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus containing monomeric infrared fluorescent protein as reporter.                                                                  | Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to correlate with protection in animals and humans, disease severity, survival, and vaccine efficacy. With the ongoing large-scale vaccination in different countries and continuous surge of new variants of global concerns, a convenient, cost-effective and high-throughput neutralization test is urgently needed. Conventional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test is tedious, time-consuming and requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Despite recent reports of neutralizations using different pseudoviruses with a luciferase or green fluorescent protein reporter, the laborious steps, inter-assay variability or high background limit their high-throughput potential. In this study we generated lentivirus-based pseudoviruses containing a monomeric infrared fluorescent protein reporter to develop neutralization assays. Similar tropism, infection kinetics and mechanism of entry through receptor-mediated endocytosis were found in the three pseudoviruses generated. Compared with pseudovirus D614, pseudovirus with D614G mutation had decreased shedding and higher density of S1 protein present on particles. The 50% neutralization titers to pseudoviruses D614 or D614G correlated with the plaque reduction neutralization titers to live SARS-CoV-2. The turn-around time of 48-72 h, minimal autofluorescence, one-step image quantification, expandable to 384-well, sequential readouts and dual quantifications by flow cytometry support its high-throughput and versatile applications at a non-reference and biosafety level 2 laboratory, in particular for assessing the neutralization sensitivity of new variants by sera from natural infection or different vaccinations during our fight against the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 33926498 | Ethical considerations and patient safety concerns for cancelling non-urgent surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic: a review.                                                                                      | At the time of writing of this article, there have been over 110 million cases and 2.4 million deaths worldwide since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, postponing millions of non-urgent surgeries. Existing literature explores the complexities of rationing medical care. However, implications of non-urgent surgery postponement during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been analyzed within the context of the four pillars of medical ethics. The objective of this review is to discuss the ethics of elective surgery cancellation during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy. This review hypothesizes that a more equitable decision-making algorithm can be formulated by analyzing the ethical dilemmas of elective surgical care during the pandemic through the lens of these four pillars. This paper‚Äôs analysis shows that non-urgent surgeries treat conditions that can become urgent if left untreated. Postponement of these surgeries can cause cumulative harm downstream. An improved algorithm can address these issues of beneficence by weighing local pandemic stressors within predictive algorithms to appropriately increase surgeries. Additionally, the potential harms of performing non-urgent surgeries extend beyond the patient. Non-maleficence is maintained through using enhanced screening protocols and modifying surgical techniques to reduce risks to patients and clinicians. This model proposes a system to transfer patients from areas of high to low burden, addressing the challenge of justice by considering facility burden rather than value judgments concerning the nature of a particular surgery, such as cosmetic surgeries. Autonomy can be respected by giving patients the option to cancel or postpone non-urgent surgeries. However, in the context of limited resources in a global pandemic, autonomy is not absolute. Non-urgent surgeries can ethically be postponed in opposition to the patient‚Äôs preference. The proposed algorithm attempts to uphold the four principles of medical ethics in rationing non-urgent surgical care by building upon existing decision models, using additional measures of resource burden and surgical safety to increase health care access and decrease long-term harm as much as possible. The next global health crisis will undoubtedly present its own unique challenges. This model may serve as a comprehensive starting point in determining future guidelines for non-urgent surgical care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 33897904 | The sustainability-peace nexus in crisis contexts: how the Rohingya escaped the ethnic violence in Myanmar, but are trapped into environmental challenges in Bangladesh.                                            | Because of ethnic and cultural violence in Myanmar, approximately a million Rohingya fled to neighboring Bangladesh starting from August 2017, in what the UN has called a ‚Äútextbook example of ethnic cleansing‚Äù. Those arriving in Bangladesh were able to escape decade-long ethnic violence in Myanmar, but the Rohingya‚Äôs immediate destination, Cox‚Äôs Bazar district is one of the most climate-vulnerable and disaster-prone areas in Bangladesh. Currently, they have been subjected to extreme rainfalls, landslides, and flashfloods. With the COVID-19 pandemic, they continue to face fear and further marginalization in resource-constrained Bangladesh, as well as increased vulnerability due to tropical cyclones, flashfloods, and landslides. The Rohingya in southeast Bangladesh are now at the epicenter of a humanitarian and sustainability crisis. However, their situation is not entirely unique. Millions of displaced, stateless or refugees around the world are facing multi-dimensional crises in various complex geopolitical, and climatic situations. Using the theoretical lens of political ecology and critical development studies, this paper analyzes the sustainability-peace nexus for millions of Rohingya in Myanmar and in Bangladesh. This paper is based on information from various sources, including three ethnographic field visits in recent years, which helped to get local insights into the current sustainability challenges in this humanitarian context. The core arguments of this paper suggest that sustainability-peace nexus will especially be compromised in climate-vulnerable resource-constrained conditions. To overcome this challenge, decolonizing Rohingya solutions would be critical, by engaging the Rohingya in the process of development and meaningful change, which can affect their lives, livelihoods, and wellbeing. Even though this paper has a specific geographical focus, the insights are relevant in parts of the world facing similar social, economic, political, and environmental challenges. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

In this study, we described the dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural and urban counties in the U.S. Using data from April 1 to November 12, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, we estimated COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and conducted comparisons between urban and rural areas in three time periods at the national level, and in states with higher and lower COVID-19 incidence rates. Results at the national level showed greater COVID-19 incidence rates in urban compared to rural counties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. at the beginning of the epidemic. However, the intensity of the epidemic has shifted to a rapid surge in rural areas. In particular, high incidence states located in the Mid-west of the country had more than 3,400 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people compared to 1,284 cases per 100,000 people in urban counties nationwide during the third period (August 30 to November 12). Overall, the current epicenter of the epidemic is located in states with higher infection rates and mortality in rural areas. Infection prevention and control efforts including healthcare capacity should be scaled up in these vulnerable rural areas. Copyright ¬© 2021.

| 33859192 | Mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 from an international collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials.                                                                      | Substantial COVID-19 research investment has been allocated to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, which currently face recruitment challenges or early discontinuation. We aim to estimate the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on survival in COVID-19 from all currently available RCT evidence, published and unpublished. We present a rapid meta-analysis of ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients (protocol: <https://osf.io/QESV4/> ). We systematically identified unpublished RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane COVID-registry up to June 11, 2020), and published RCTs (PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv up to October 16, 2020). All-cause mortality has been extracted (publications/preprints) or requested from investigators and combined in random-effects meta-analyses, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), separately for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Prespecified subgroup analyses include patient setting, diagnostic confirmation, control type, and publication status. Sixty-three trials were potentially eligible. We included 14 unpublished trials (1308 patients) and 14 publications/preprints (9011 patients). Results for hydroxychloroquine are dominated by RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY, two highly pragmatic trials, which employed relatively high doses and included 4716 and 1853 patients, respectively (67% of the total sample size). The combined OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine is 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.20; I¬≤ = 0%; 26 trials; 10,012 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95%CI: 0.15, 21.13, I¬≤ = 0%; 4 trials; 307 patients). We identified no subgroup effects. We found that treatment with hydroxychloroquine is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients, and there is no benefit of chloroquine. Findings have unclear generalizability to outpatients, children, pregnant women, and people with comorbidities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33856881 | The COVID-19 Pandemic: Effects on Civil Registration of Births and Deaths and on Availability and Utility of Vital Events Data.                                                                                     | The complex and evolving picture of COVID-19-related mortality highlights the need for data to guide the response. Yet many countries are struggling to maintain their data systems, including the civil registration system, which is the foundation for detailed and continuously available mortality statistics. We conducted a search of country and development agency Web sites and partner and media reports describing disruptions to the civil registration of births and deaths associated with COVID-19 related restrictions.We found considerable intercountry variation and grouped countries according to the level of disruption to birth and particularly death registration. Only a minority of the 66 countries were able to maintain service continuity during the COVID-19 restrictions. In the majority, a combination of legal and operational challenges resulted in declines in birth and death registration. Few countries established business continuity plans or developed strategies to deal with the backlog when restrictions are lifted.Civil registration systems and the vital statistics they generate must be strengthened as essential services during health emergencies and as core components of the response to COVID-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 33851191 | Predicting the severity of disease progression in COVID-19 at the individual and population level: A mathematical model.                                                                                            | The impact of COVID-19 disease on health and economy has been global, and the magnitude of devastation is unparalleled in modern history. Any potential course of action to manage this complex disease requires the systematic and efficient analysis of data that can delineate the underlying pathogenesis. We have developed a mathematical model of disease progression to predict the clinical outcome, utilizing a set of causal factors known to contribute to COVID-19 pathology such as age, comorbidities, and certain viral and immunological parameters. Viral load and selected indicators of a dysfunctional immune response, such as cytokines IL-6 and IFNŒ±, which contribute to the cytokine storm and fever, parameters of inflammation d-dimer and ferritin, aberrations in lymphocyte number, lymphopenia, and neutralizing antibodies were included for the analysis. The model provides a framework to unravel the multi-factorial complexities of the immune response manifested in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Further, this model can be valuable to predict clinical outcome at an individual level, and to develop strategies for allocating appropriate resources to mitigate severe cases at a population level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33826985 | Fine-Scale Temporal Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Abundance in Wastewater during A COVID-19 Lockdown.                                                                                                                  | Wastewater is a pooled sampling instrument that may provide rapid and even early disease signals in the surveillance of COVID-19 disease at the community level, yet the fine-scale temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater remains poorly understood. This study tracked the daily dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Honolulu during a rapidly expanding COVID-19 outbreak and a responding four-week lockdown that resulted in a rapid decrease of daily clinical COVID-19 new cases. The wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration from both WWTPs, as measured by three quantification assays (N1, N2, and E), exhibited both significant inter-day fluctuations (101.2-105.1 gene copies or GC/L in wastewater liquid fractions, or 101.4-106.2 GC/g in solid fractions) and an overall downward trend over the lockdown period. Strong and significant correlation was observed in measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations between the solid and liquid wastewater fractions, with the solid fraction containing majority (82.5%-92.5%) of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA mass and the solid-liquid SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration ratios ranging from 103.6 to 104.3 mL/g. The measured wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration was normalized by three endogenous fecal RNA viruses (F+ RNA coliphages Group II and III, and pepper mild mottle virus) to account for variations that may occur during the multi-step wastewater processing and molecular quantification, and the normalized abundance also exhibited similar daily fluctuations and overall downward trend over the sampling period.

| 33789080 | Provision of medication abortion in Hawai‚Äôi during COVID-19: Practical experience with multiple care delivery models.                                                                                               | To demonstrate the effectiveness of medication abortion with the implementation of telemedicine and a no-test protocol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who had a medication abortion up to 77 days gestation at the University of Hawai‚Äôi between April and November 2020. Patients had the option of traditional in clinic care or telemedicine with either in clinic pickup or mailing of medications. During this time, a no-test protocol for medication abortion without prior labs or ultrasound was in place for eligible patients. The primary outcome was the rate of successful medication abortion without surgical intervention. Secondary outcomes included abortion-related complications. A total of 334 patients were dispensed mifepristone and misoprostol, 149 (44.6%) with telemedicine with in-person pickup of medications, 75 (22.5%) via telemedicine with medications mailed, and 110 (32.9%) via traditional in person visits. The overall rate of complete medication abortion without surgical intervention was 95.8%, with success rates of 96.8, 97.1, and 93.6% for the clinic pickup, mail, and clinic visit groups, respectively. Success for those without an ultrasound performed prior to the procedure was 96.6%, compared to 95.5% for those with ultrasound. We obtained follow-up data for 87.8% of participants. Medication abortion was safe and effective while offering multiple modes of care delivery including telemedicine visits without an ultrasound performed prior to dispensing medications. Incorporating telemedicine and a no-test protocol for medication abortion is safe and has the potential to expand access to abortion care. All care models had low rates of adverse events, which contradicts the idea that the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategyincreases the safety of medication abortion.

| 33781762 | Expansion of a direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion service in the United States and experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                                                    | To present updated evidence on the safety, efficacy and acceptability of a direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion service and describe how the service functioned during the COVID-19 pandemic. We offered the study at 10 sites that provided the service in 13 states and Washington DC. Interested individuals obtained any needed preabortion tests locally and had a videoconference with a study clinician. Sites sent study packages containing mifepristone and misoprostol by mail and had remote follow-up consultations within one month by telephone (or by online survey, if the participant could not be reached) to evaluate abortion completeness. The analysis was descriptive. We mailed 1390 packages between May 2016 and September 2020. Of the 83% (1157/1390) of abortions for which we obtained outcome information, 95% (1103/1157) were completed without a procedure. Participants made 70 unplanned visits to emergency rooms or urgent care centers for reasons related to the abortion (6%), and 10 serious adverse events occurred, including 5 transfusions (0.4%). Enrollment increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Although a screening ultrasound was required, sites determined in 52% (346/669) of abortions that occurred during COVID that those participants should not get the test to protect their health. Use of urine pregnancy test to confirm abortion completion increased from 67% (144/214) in the 6 months prior to COVID to 90% (602/669) in the 6 months during COVID. Nearly all satisfaction questionnaires (99%, 1013/1022) recorded that participants were satisfied with the service. This direct-to-patient telemedicine service was safe, effective, and acceptable, and supports the claim that there is no medical reason for mifepristone to be dispensed in clinics as required by the Food and Drug Administration. In some cases, participants did not need to visit any facilities to obtain the service, which was critical to protecting patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical abortion using telemedicine and mail is effective and can be safely provided without a pretreatment ultrasound. This method of service delivery has the potential to greatly improve access to abortion care in the United States.

In response, health promotion initiatives were urgently developed and applied around the world. A selection of case studies from five countries, based on the Socio-Ecological Model of Health Promotion, exemplify ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô action and challenges for health promotion intervention, research, and policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions range from a focus on individuals/families, organizations, communities and in healthcare, public health, education and media systems, health-promoting settings, and policy. Lessons learned highlight the need for emphasizing equity, trust, systems approach, and sustained action in future health promotion preparedness strategies. Challenges and opportunities are highlighted regarding the need for rapid response, clear communication based on health literacy, and collaboration across countries, disciplines, and health and education systems for meaningful solutions to global health crises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33770003 | The Relationship Between Children‚Äôs Problematic Internet-related Behaviors and Psychological Distress During the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study.                                              | The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has generated negative effects on psychological well-being worldwide, including in schoolchildren. Government requirements to stay at home and avoid social and school settings may impact psychological well-being by modifying various behaviors such as problematic phone and Internet use, yet there is a paucity of research on this issue. This study examined whether the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic gaming (PG), and psychological distress, specifically the pattern of relationships between PSU, PG, and psychological distress in schoolchildren. Longitudinal data on psychological distress, PSU, and PG were collected from 575 children in primary schools in 3 waves: Waves 1 and 2 were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak and Wave 3 during the outbreak. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine relationships between factors across the 3 waves. Cross-lagged models found that higher levels of PSU were not significantly related prospectively to greater psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak, but this prospective relationship became significant during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas PG was associated prospectively with psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, between Waves 1 and 2), this association became nonsignificant during the COVID-19 lockdown (ie, between Waves 2 and 3). The COVID-19 outbreak has seemed to change prospective relationships between PSU and psychological distress and PG and psychological distress in schoolchildren. Future research should examine whether restrictions on or information provided to schoolchildren may exacerbate PSUs effects on psychological distress.

| 33769536 | Factors associated with the intention to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine among a racially/ethnically diverse sample of women in the USA.                                                                                  | Widespread uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is critical to halt the pandemic. At present, little is known about factors that will affect vaccine uptake, especially among diverse racial/ethnic communities that have experienced the highest burden of COVID. We administered an online survey to a Qualtrics respondent panel of women ages 27-45 years (N = 396) to assess vaccine intentions and attitudes, and trusted vaccine information sources. 56.8% intended to be vaccinated and 25.5% were unsure. In bivariate analyses, a greater percentage of non-Latina White (NLW) and Chinese women reported that they would be vaccinated, compared with Latina and non-Latina Black (NLB) women (p &lt; 0.001). Those who were uninsured, unemployed and those with lower incomes were less likely to say that they would be vaccinated. In analyses stratified by race/ethnicity, NLB women remained significantly less likely to report that they would be vaccinated compared with NLW women (adjusted odds ratio: 0.47; 95% confidence interval: 0.23, 0.94), controlling for age, marital status, income, education, employment, and insurance status. When analyses were additionally controlled for beliefs in vaccine safety and efficacy, racial/ethnic differences were no longer significant (adjusted odds ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.31, 1.34). Given that NLB women were less likely to report the intention to be vaccinated, targeted efforts will be needed to promote vaccine uptake. It will be critical to emphasize that the vaccine is safe and effective; this message may be best delivered by trusted community members.

| 33746047 | Association of clinical factors and recent anticancer therapy with COVID-19 severity among patients with cancer: a report from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium.                                                  | Patients with cancer may be at high risk of adverse outcomes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We analyzed a cohort of patients with cancer and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) reported to the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) to identify prognostic clinical factors, including laboratory measurements and anticancer therapies. Patients with active or historical cancer and a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis recorded between 17 March and 18 November 2020 were included. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity measured on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care unit, mechanically ventilated, died within 30 days). Multivariable regression models included demographics, cancer status, anticancer therapy and timing, COVID-19-directed therapies, and laboratory measurements (among hospitalized patients). A total of 4966 patients were included (median age 66 years, 51% female, 50% non-Hispanic white); 2872 (58%) were hospitalized and 695 (14%) died; 61% had cancer that was present, diagnosed, or treated within the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Older age, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, and hematologic malignancy were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Among hospitalized patients, low or high absolute lymphocyte count; high absolute neutrophil count; low platelet count; abnormal creatinine; troponin; lactate dehydrogenase; and C-reactive protein were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Patients diagnosed early in the COVID-19 pandemic (January-April 2020) had worse outcomes than those diagnosed later. Specific anticancer therapies (e.g.¬†R-CHOP, platinum combined with etoposide, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) were associated with high 30-day all-cause mortality. Clinical factors (e.g.¬†older age, hematological malignancy, recent chemotherapy) and laboratory measurements were associated with poor outcomes among patients with cancer and COVID-19. Although further studies are needed, caution may be required in utilizing particular anticancer therapies. NCT04354701. Copyright ¬© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

We collected data on the nutrition care provided to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 101) in this cohort were older adults and had elevated body mass index. The most frequent nutrition problems were inadequate oral intake (46.7%), inadequate energy intake (18.9%), and malnutrition (18.4%). These problems were managed predominantly with enteral nutrition, food supplements, and multivitamin-multimineral supplement therapy. Over 90% of documented problems required a follow-up. This data set is the first of its kind to report on the types of nutrition diagnoses and interventions for COVID-19 cases used by RDNs and highlights the need for increased and continued nutrition care. ¬© 2021 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Burns School of Medicine Biocontainment Facility, RNA was extracted from an oropharyngeal swab and a nasal swab from 2 patients from Hawai‚Äôi who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. Following PCR, the 2 viral strains were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGAX. Phylogenetic tree results indicate that the virus has been introduced to Hawai‚Äôi from multiple sources. Further, we decoded 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 13 unique SARS-CoV-2 genomes within this region of the S gene, with 1 non-synonymous mutation (P681H) found in the 2 Hawai‚Äôi strains. The P681H mutation has unique and emerging characteristics with a significant exponential increase in worldwide frequency when compared to the plateauing of the now universal D614G mutation. The P681H mutation is also characteristic of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Additionally, several mutations resulting in cysteine residues were detected, potentially resulting in disruption of the disulfide bridges in and around the receptor-binding domain. Targeted sequence characterization is warranted to determine the origin of multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Hawai‚Äôi. ¬©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‚Äòi (UHP Hawai‚Äòi).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 33706209 | Exploring the impacts of travel-implied policy factors on COVID-19 spread within communities based on multi-source data interpretations.                                                                            | The global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the implementation of social distancing measures such as work-from-home orders that have drastically changed people‚Äôs travel-related behavior. As countries are easing up these measures and people are resuming their pre-pandemic activities, the second wave of COVID-19 is observed in many countries. This study proposes a Community Activity Score (CAS) based on inter-community traffic characteristics (in and out of community traffic volume and travel distance) to capture the current travel-related activity level compared to the pre-pandemic baseline and study its relationship with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Fourteen other travel-related factors belonging to five categories (Social Distancing Index, residents staying at home, travel frequency and distance, mobility trend, and out-of-county visitors) and three social distancing measures (stay-at-home order, face-covering order, and self-quarantine for out-of-county travels) are also considered to reflect the likelihood of exposure to the COVID-19. Considering that it usually takes days from exposure to confirming the infection, the exposure-to-confirm temporal delay between the time-varying travel-related factors and their impacts on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is considered in this study. Honolulu County in the State of Hawaii is used as a case study to evaluate the proposed CAS and other factors on confirmed COVID-19 cases with various temporal delays at a county-level. Negative Binomial models were chosen to study the impacts of travel-related factors and social distancing measures on COVID-19 cases. The case study results show that CAS and other factors are correlated with COVID-19 spread, and models that factor in the exposure-to-confirm temporal delay perform better in forecasting COVID-19 cases later. Policymakers can use the study‚Äôs various findings and insights to evaluate the impacts of social distancing policies on travel and effectively allocate resources for the possible increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases.

| 33661727 | An Emergent Network for the Diffusion of Innovations Among Local Health Departments at the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic.                                                                                          | Communication networks among professionals can be pathways for accelerating the diffusion of innovations if some local health departments (LHDs) drive the spread of knowledge. Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new public health practices, programs, or policies may find our results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as-usual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 33657176 | Development of a multiplex Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay for on-site diagnosis of SARS CoV-2.                                                                                                 | A newly identified coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), has spread rapidly from its epicenter in China to more than 150 countries across six continents. In this study, we have designed three reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) primer sets to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid protein (N) genes of SARS CoV-2. For one tube reaction, the detection limits for five combination SARS CoV-2 LAMP primer sets (RdRP/E, RdRP/N, E/N, RdRP/E/N and RdRP/N/Internal control (actin beta)) were evaluated with a clinical nasopharyngeal swab sample. Among the five combination, the RdRP/E and RdRP/N/IC multiplex LAMP assays showed low detection limits. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay were evaluated and compared to that of the widely used Allplex‚Ñ¢ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, South Korea) and PowerChek‚Ñ¢ 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR kit (Kogenebiotech, Seoul, South Korea) for 130 clinical samples from 91 SARS CoV-2 patients and 162 NP specimens from individuals with (72) and without (90) viral respiratory infections. The multiplex RdRP (FAM)/N (CY5)/IC (Hex) RT-LAMP assay showed comparable sensitivities (RdRP: 93.85%, N: 94.62% and RdRP/N: 96.92%) to that of the Allplex‚Ñ¢ 2019-nCoV Assay (100%) and superior to those of PowerChek‚Ñ¢ 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR kit (RdRP: 92.31%, E: 93.85% and RdRP/E: 95.38%).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 33607081 | Validation of the GeneXpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay using saliva as biological specimen.                                                                                                                        | In the pandemic, rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in controlling the outbreak. Recent studies have shown a high detection rate using saliva/oral fluids as specimens for laboratory detection of the virus. We intended to evaluate the test performance of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge assay in comparison to a conventional qRT-PCR testing, using saliva as biological specimen. Forty saliva samples from symptomatic participants were collected. Conventional qRT-PCR was performed for amplification of E and RdRp genes and the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay amplified E and N2 genes. In the conventional assay, the median cycle threshold value of the E gene was 34.9, and of the RdRp gene was 38.3. In the Xpert Xpress assay, the median cycle threshold value of the E gene was 29.7, and of the N2 gene was 31.6.

| 33606666 | A Bayesian Mixture Model for Predicting the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States.                                                                                                                                 | An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic affecting virtually every country. As of August 31, 2020, globally, there have been approximately 25,500,000 confirmed cases and 850,000 deaths; in the United States (50 states plus District of Columbia), there have been more than 6,000,000 confirmed cases and 183,000 deaths. We propose a Bayesian mixture model to predict and monitor COVID-19 mortality across the United States. The model captures skewed unimodal (prolonged recovery) or multimodal (multiple surges) curves. The results show that across all states, the first peak dates of mortality varied between April 4, 2020 for Alaska and June 18, 2020 for Arkansas. As of August 31, 2020, 31 states had a clear bimodal curve showing a strong second surge. The peak date for a second surge ranged from July 1, 2020 for Virginia to September 12, 2020 for Hawaii. The first peak for the United States occurred about April 16, 2020-dominated by New York and New Jersey-and a second peak on August 6, 2020-dominated by California, Texas, and Florida. Reliable models for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic are essential to informing resource allocation and intervention strategies. A Bayesian mixture model was able to more accurately predict the shape of the mortality curves across the United States than other models, including the timing of multiple peaks. However, given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is important that the results be updated regularly to identify and better monitor future waves, and characterize the epidemiology of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 33606656 | Exploring Usage of COVID Coach, a Public Mental Health App Designed for the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evaluation of Analytics Data.                                                                                        | The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted mental health and well-being. Mobile mental health apps can be scalable and useful tools in large-scale disaster responses and are particularly promising for reaching vulnerable populations. COVID Coach is a free, evidence-informed mobile app designed specifically to provide tools and resources for addressing COVID-19-related stress. The purpose of this study was to characterize the overall usage of COVID Coach, explore retention and return usage, and assess whether the app was reaching individuals who may benefit from mental health resources. Anonymous usage data collected from COVID Coach between May 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020, were extracted and analyzed for this study. The sample included 49,287 unique user codes and 3,368,931 in-app events. Usage of interactive tools for coping and stress management comprised the majority of key app events (n=325,691, 70.4%), and the majority of app users tried a tool for managing stress (n=28,009, 58.8%). COVID Coach was utilized for ‚â§3 days by 80.9% (n=34,611) of the sample whose first day of app use occurred within the 6-month observation window. Usage of the key content in COVID Coach predicted returning to the app for a second day. Among those who tried at least one coping tool on their first day of app use, 57.2% (n=11,444) returned for a second visit; whereas only 46.3% (n=10,546) of those who did not try a tool returned (P&lt;.001). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were prevalent among app users. For example, among app users who completed an anxiety assessment on their first day of app use (n=4870, 11.4% of users), 55.1% (n=2680) reported levels of anxiety that were moderate to severe, and 29.9% (n=1455) of scores fell into the severe symptom range. On average, those with moderate levels of depression on their first day of app use returned to the app for a greater number of days (mean 3.72 days) than those with minimal symptoms (mean 3.08 days; t1=3.01, P=.003). Individuals with significant PTSD symptoms on their first day of app use utilized the app for a significantly greater number of days (mean 3.79 days) than those with fewer symptoms (mean 3.13 days; t1=2.29, P=.02). As the mental health impacts of the pandemic continue to be widespread and increasing, digital health resources, such as apps like COVID Coach, are a scalable way to provide evidence-informed tools and resources.

| 33495523 | Psychological distress and internet-related behaviors between schoolchildren with and without overweight during the COVID-19 outbreak.                                                                              | The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and its resulting social policy changes may result in psychological distress among schoolchildren with overweight. This study thus aimed to (1) compare psychological distress (including fear of COVID-19 infection, stress, anxiety, and depression), perceived weight stigma, and problematic internet-related behaviors between schoolchildren with and without overweight; (2) assess whether perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors explained psychological distress. Schoolchildren (n = 1357; mean age = 10.7 years) with overweight (n = 236) and without overweight (n = 1121) completed an online survey assessing their fear of COVID-19 infection, stress, anxiety, depression, perceived weight stigma, problematic smartphone application use, problematic social media use, and problematic gaming. Schoolchildren with overweight had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 infection fear, stress, depression, perceived weight stigma, and problematic social media use than those without overweight. Regression models showed that perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors were significant predictors of psychological distress among schoolchildren with overweight. Strategies to manage perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors may have a positive influence on mental health among schoolchildren with overweight under health-threatening circumstances, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Efforts to contain the virus resulted in changes to restaurants‚Äô operations and disrupted HDB implementation efforts. Economic repercussions from containment efforts have exacerbated food insecurity, limited access to healthy foods, and created obstacles to chronic disease management. Promoting healthy default options is critical at a time when engaging in healthy behaviors is difficult, but important, to both prevent and manage chronic disease and decrease COVID-19 risk. This commentary discusses COVID-19‚Äôs impact on restaurant operations and healthy eating, and the resulting challenges and opportunities for this promising health promotion intervention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 33471778 | Distance Management of Spinal Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: Evidence-Based Patient and Clinician Guides From the Global Spine Care Initiative.                                                 | The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly limited patients‚Äô access to care for spine-related symptoms and disorders. However, physical distancing between clinicians and patients with spine-related symptoms is not solely limited to restrictions imposed by pandemic-related lockdowns. In most low- and middle-income countries, as well as many underserved marginalized communities in high-income countries, there is little to no access to clinicians trained in evidence-based care for people experiencing spinal pain. The aim of this study is to describe the development and present the components of evidence-based patient and clinician guides for the management of spinal disorders where in-person care is not available. Ultimately, two sets of guides were developed (one for patients and one for clinicians) by extracting information from the published Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) papers. An international, interprofessional team of 29 participants from 10 countries on 4 continents participated. The team included practitioners in family medicine, neurology, physiatry, rheumatology, psychology, chiropractic, physical therapy, and yoga, as well as epidemiologists, research methodologists, and laypeople. The participants were invited to review, edit, and comment on the guides in an open iterative consensus process. The Patient Guide is a simple 2-step process. The first step describes the nature of the symptoms or concerns. The second step provides information that a patient can use when considering self-care, determining whether to contact a clinician, or considering seeking emergency care. The Clinician Guide is a 5-step process: (1) Obtain and document patient demographics, location of primary clinical symptoms, and psychosocial information. (2) Review the symptoms noted in the patient guide. (3) Determine the GSCI classification of the patient‚Äôs spine-related complaints. (4) Ask additional questions to determine the GSCI subclassification of the symptom pattern. (5) Consider appropriate treatment interventions. The Patient and Clinician Guides are designed to be sufficiently clear to be useful to all patients and clinicians, irrespective of their location, education, professional qualifications, and experience. However, they are comprehensive enough to provide guidance on the management of all spine-related symptoms or disorders, including triage for serious and specific diseases. They are consistent with widely accepted evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. They also allow for adequate documentation and medical record keeping. These guides should be of value during periods of government-mandated physical or social distancing due to infectious diseases, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. They should also be of value in underserved communities in high-, middle-, and low-income countries where there is a dearth of accessible trained spine care clinicians. These guides have the potential to reduce the overutilization of unnecessary and expensive interventions while empowering patients to self-manage uncomplicated spinal pain with the assistance of their clinician, either through direct in-person consultation or via telehealth communication. ¬©Scott Haldeman, Margareta Nordin, Patricia Tavares, Rajani Mullerpatan, Deborah Kopansky-Giles, Vincent Setlhare, Roger Chou, Eric Hurwitz, Caroline Treanor, Jan Hartvigsen, Michael Schneider, Ralph Gay, Jean Moss, Joan Haldeman, David Gryfe, Adam Wilkey, Richard Brown, Geoff Outerbridge, Stefan Eberspaecher, Linda Carroll, Reginald Engelbrecht, Kait Graham, Nathan Cashion, Stefanie Ince, Erin Moon.

| 33464637 | Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of peripheral blood reveals an epigenetic signature associated with severe COVID-19.                                                                                          | The global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic RNA virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Although most patients with COVID-19 have mild illness and may be asymptomatic, some will develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are capable of hijacking the epigenetic landscape of host immune cells to evade antiviral defense. Yet, there remain considerable gaps in our understanding of immune cell epigenetic changes associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection pathology. Here, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia compared with uninfected, hospitalized influenza, untreated primary HIV infection, and mild/moderate COVID-19 HIV coinfected individuals. Cell-type deconvolution analyses confirmed lymphopenia in severe COVID-19 and revealed a high percentage of estimated neutrophils suggesting perturbations to DNAm associated with granulopoiesis. We observed a distinct DNAm signature of severe COVID-19 characterized by hypermethylation of IFN-related genes and hypomethylation of inflammatory genes, reinforcing observations in infection models and single-cell transcriptional studies of severe COVID-19. Epigenetic clock analyses revealed severe COVID-19 was associated with an increased DNAm age and elevated mortality risk according to GrimAge, further validating the epigenetic clock as a predictor of disease and mortality risk. Our epigenetic results reveal a discovery DNAm signature of severe COVID-19 in blood potentially useful for corroborating clinical assessments, informing pathogenic mechanisms, and revealing new therapeutic targets against SARS-CoV-2. ¬©2021 Society for Leukocyte Biology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 33442699 | Genetic Characteristics and Phylogeny of 969-bp S Gene Sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from Hawaii Reveals the Worldwide Emerging P681H Mutation.                                                                            | COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the world, caused over 1.8 million deaths in the first year, and severely affected the global economy. Hawaii is not spared from the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the local population, including high infection rates in racial and ethnic minorities. Early in the pandemic, we described in this journal various technologies used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Herein we characterize a 969-bp SARS-CoV-2 segment of the S gene downstream of the receptor-binding domain. At the John A. Burns School of Medicine Biocontainment Facility, RNA was extracted from an oropharyngeal swab and a nasal swab from two patients from Hawaii who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. Following PCR, the two viral strains were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGAX. Phylogenetic tree results indicate that the virus has been introduced to Hawaii from multiple sources. Further, we decoded 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 13 unique SARS-CoV-2 genomes within this region of the S gene, with one non-synonymous mutation (P681H) found in the two Hawaii strains. The P681H mutation has unique and emerging characteristics with a significant exponential increase in worldwide frequency when compared to the plateauing of the now universal D614G mutation. The P681H mutation is also characteristic of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Additionally, several mutations resulting in cysteine residues were detected, potentially resulting in disruption of the disulfide bridges in and around the receptor-binding domain. Targeted sequence characterization is warranted to determine the origin of multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Hawaii.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 33422679 | Coronavirus 2019 Infectious Disease Epidemic: Where We Are, What Can Be Done and Hope For.                                                                                                                          | Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads mainly by means of aerosols (microdroplets) in enclosed environments, especially those in which temperature and humidity are regulated by means of air-conditioning. About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Among them, approximately 25% require hospitalization. In medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill.¬†During this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic-this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 years very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality rate vary because the definition of COVID-19-related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death rate at 154.9 per 100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The United States includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a cofactor, have lower death rates. Numerous therapies are being developed, and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only approximately 50% of the U.S. population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. By sharing accurate information, physicians, health professionals, and scientists play a key role in addressing myths and anxiety, help public health officials enact measures to decrease infections, and provide the best care for those who become sick.

| 33422626 | National Psoriasis Foundation COVID-19 Task Force guidance for management of psoriatic disease during the pandemic: Version 2-Advances in psoriatic disease management, COVID-19 vaccines, and COVID-19 treatments. | To update guidance regarding the management of psoriatic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force (TF) includes 18 physician voting members with expertise in dermatology, rheumatology, epidemiology, infectious diseases, and critical care. The TF was supplemented by nonvoting members, which included fellows and National Psoriasis Foundation staff. Clinical questions relevant to the psoriatic disease community were informed by inquiries received by the National Psoriasis Foundation. A Delphi process was conducted. The TF updated evidence for the original 22 statements and added 5 new recommendations. The average of the votes was within the category of agreement for all statements, 13 with high consensus and 14 with moderate consensus. The evidence behind many guidance statements is variable in quality and/or quantity. These statements provide guidance for the treatment of patients with psoriatic disease on topics including how the disease and its treatments affect COVID-19 risk, how medical care can be optimized during the pandemic, what patients should do to lower their risk of getting infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (including novel vaccination), and what they should do if they develop COVID-19. The guidance is a living document that is continuously updated by the TF as data emerge.

Exogenous surfactant is a life-saving treatment for premature infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. This treatment has also been tested for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with limited success possibly due to the complexity of that syndrome. The 60-year history of successes and failures associated with surfactant therapy distinguishes it from many other treatments currently being tested for COVID-19 and provides the opportunity to discuss the factors that may influence the success of this therapy. Clinical data provide a strong rationale for using exogenous surfactant in COVID-19 patients. Success of this therapy may be influenced by the mechanical ventilation strategy, the timing of treatment, the doses delivered, the method of delivery and the preparations utilized. In addition, future development of enhanced preparations may improve this treatment approach. Overall, results from ongoing trials may not only provide data to indicate if this therapy is effective for COVID-19 patients, but also lead to further scientific understanding and improved treatment strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 33316097 | Early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on outpatient migraine care in Hawaii: Results of a quality improvement survey.                                                                                               | A survey was implemented for early assessment of pandemic-related practice processes and quality improvement (QI). In response to the public health measures in Hawaii to curtail the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, Hawaii Pacific Neuroscience (HPN) adapted their patient care to ensure continuity of neurological treatment. The telephone survey was conducted on patients seen at HPN during the period of April 22, 2020-May 18, 2020 to address four areas related to patients‚Äô outpatient experience: delivery of care, general well-being, experience with telemedicine, and disease-specific questions. A total of 928 patients were contacted of which 429 (46.2%) patients responded and 367 (85.5%) agreed to participate. A total of 133 patients with migraine and 234 patients with other neurological conditions provided responses. Our migraine patients‚Äô survey responses suggest that their well-being was disproportionately negatively affected by the pandemic. Survey respondents with migraine were significantly more likely than their non-migraine peers to report worsening anxiety and sleep problems \[62/132 (47.0%) vs.¬†78/234 (33.3%), œá2 = 6.64, p = 0.010, and 64/132 (48.5%) vs.¬†73/234 (31.2%), œá2 = 10.77, p = 0.001\]; migraine patients also reported worsening of depression as a result of the pandemic more than patients with other diagnoses, though this was not statistically significant \[44/132 (33.3%) vs.¬†57/234 (24.4%), œá2 = 3.40, p = 0.065\]. In regard to access to healthcare, significantly more migraine patients reported running out of medications than those with other diagnoses \[20/133 (15.0%) vs.¬†18/234 (7.7%), œá2 = 4.93, p = 0.026\]. More avoided seeking medical help for new health problems because of the pandemic \[30/133 (22.6%) vs.¬†30/234 (12.8%), œá2 = 5.88, p = 0.015\]. Migraine patients were also significantly impacted economically by the pandemic; 43/132 (32.4%) of migraine patients reported losing their jobs as the result of the pandemic versus 34/234 (14.5%) of their peers (œá2 = 11.20, p &lt; 0.001). An increase in headache severity or frequency was reported in 39/118 (33.1%) of respondents and 19/118 (16.1%) reported to using more abortive therapy than usual. Telemedicine was well received by almost all patients who took advantage of the option. Most of those patients found telemedicine to be easy to use and as valuable as an in-person visit. Migraine patients indicated with more frequency that without the telemedicine option, they would have missed their medical appointments \[37/68 (54.4%) vs.¬†56/144 (38.6%), œá2 = 4.31, p = 0.038\]; a majority would prefer or consider telemedicine for future appointments over in-person visits. Insights gained from this QI survey to the practice‚Äôs new pandemic-related processes include stressing lifestyle modification, optimizing treatment plans, and continuing the option of telemedicine. ¬© 2020 American Headache Society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 33301024 | Theory-based Behavioral Predictors of Self-reported Use of Face Coverings in Public Settings during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States.                                                                     | Investigating antecedents of behaviors, such as wearing face coverings, is critical for developing strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The purpose of this study was to determine associations between theory-based behavioral predictors of intention to wear a face covering and actual wearing of a face covering in public. Data from a cross-sectional panel survey of U.S. adults conducted in May and June 2020 (N = 1,004) were used to test a theory-based behavioral path model. We (a) examined predictors of intention to wear a face covering, (b) reported use of cloth face coverings, and (c) reported use of other face masks (e.g., a surgical mask or N95 respirator) in public. We found that being female, perceived importance of others wanting the respondent to wear a face covering, confidence to wear a face covering, and perceived importance of personal face covering use was positively associated with intention to wear a face covering in public. Intention to wear a face covering was positively associated with self-reported wearing of a cloth face covering if other people were observed wearing cloth face coverings in public at least ‚Äúrarely‚Äù (aOR = 1.43), with stronger associations if they reported ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù (aOR = 1.83), ‚Äúoften‚Äù (aOR = 2.32), or ‚Äúalways‚Äù (aOR = 2.96). For other types of face masks, a positive association between intention and behavior was only present when observing others wearing face masks ‚Äúoften‚Äù (aOR = 1.25) or ‚Äúalways‚Äù (aOR = 1.48).

| 33276110 | Unique pattern of COVID-19 infection in the State of Hawai‚Äôi.                                                                                                                                                       | This is a brief report on an unusual observation regarding COVID-19 cases. The State of Hawaii is one of the most remote of the Pacific islands and the population is approximately 1.4 million. The racial and ethnic diversity is very high. For example, white Caucasians comprise ‚àº25%, Asians including Japanese, Chinese, and other Asians account for ‚àº30%, Hawaiians for 20%, and Pacific Islanders mostly from Micronesia and Samoa comprise ‚àº4%. We discovered that the COVID-19 rate in the latter group was up to 10 times that in all of the other groups combined and they accounted for almost 30% of cases. Moreover, we are unaware of COVID-19 transmission from Pacific Islanders to islanders with other ethnicities. Thus, there is an epidemic within the epidemic in Hawai‚Äôi.

| 33270782 | The lower COVID-19 related mortality and incidence rates in Eastern European countries are associated with delayed start of community circulation.                                                                  | The purpose of this analysis was to assess the variations in COVID-19 related mortality in relation to the time differences in the commencement of virus circulation and containment measures in the European Region. The data for the current analysis (N = 50 countries) were retrieved from the John Hopkins University dataset on the 7th of May 2020, with countries as study units. A piecewise regression analysis was conducted with mortality and cumulative incidence rates introduced as dependent variables and time interval (days from the 22nd of January to the date when 100 first cases were reported) as the main predictor. The country average life expectancy at birth and outpatient contacts per person per year were statistically adjusted for in the regression model. Mortality and incidence were strongly and inversely intercorrelated with days from January 22, respectively -0.83 (p&lt;0.001) and -0.73 (p&lt;0.001). Adjusting for average life expectancy and outpatients contacts per person per year, between days 33 to 50 from the 22nd of the January, the average mortality rate decreased by 30.1/million per day (95% CI: 22.7, 37.6, p&lt;0.001). During interval 51 to 73 days, the change in mortality was no longer statistically significant but still showed a decreasing trend. A similar relationship with time interval was found for incidence. Life expectancy and outpatients contacts per person per year were not associated with mortality rate. Countries in Europe that had the earliest COVID-19 circulation suffered the worst consequences in terms of health outcomes, specifically mortality. The drastic social isolation measures, quickly undertaken in response to those initial outbreaks appear effective, especially in Eastern European countries, where community circulation started after March 11th. The study demonstrates that efforts to delay the early spread of the virus may have saved an average 30 deaths daily per one million inhabitants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 33251328 | Heterogeneity in SIR epidemics modeling: superspreaders and herd immunity.                                                                                                                                          | Deterministic epidemic models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, are immensely useful even if they lack the nuance and complexity of social contacts at the heart of network science modeling. Here we present a simple modification of the SIR equations to include the heterogeneity of social connection networks. A typical power-law model of social interactions from network science reproduces the observation that individuals with a high number of contacts, ‚Äúhubs‚Äù or ‚Äúsuperspreaders‚Äù, can become the primary conduits for transmission. Conversely, once the tail of the distribution is saturated, herd immunity sets in at a smaller overall recovered fraction than in the analogous SIR model. The new dynamical equations suggest that cutting off the tail of the social connection distribution, i.e., stopping superspreaders, is an efficient non-pharmaceutical intervention to slow the spread of a pandemic, such as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). ¬© The Author(s) 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

However, our understanding remains limited in how people would react to such control measures, as well as how people would resume their normal behaviours when those orders were relaxed. We utilize an integrated dataset of real-time mobile device location data involving 100 million devices in the contiguous United States (plus Alaska and Hawaii) from February 2, 2020 to May 30, 2020. Built upon the common human mobility metrics, we construct a Social Distancing Index (SDI) to evaluate people‚Äôs mobility pattern changes along with the spread of COVID-19 at different geographic levels. We find that both government orders and local outbreak severity significantly contribute to the strength of social distancing. As people tend to practice less social distancing immediately after they observe a sign of local mitigation, we identify several states and counties with higher risks of continuous community transmission and a second outbreak. Our proposed index could help policymakers and researchers monitor people‚Äôs real-time mobility behaviours, understand the influence of government orders, and evaluate the risk of local outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 33236896 | Airborne Transmission of COVID-19: Aerosol Dispersion, Lung Deposition, and Virus-Receptor Interactions.                                                                                                            | Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is now causing a global pandemic. Aerosol transmission of COVID-19, although plausible, has not been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a general transmission route. Considering the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially nosocomial outbreaks and other superspreading events, there is an urgent need to study the possibility of airborne transmission and its impact on the lung, the primary body organ attacked by the virus. Here, we review the complete pathway of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from aerosol dispersion in air to subsequent biological uptake after inhalation. In particular, we first review the aerodynamic and colloidal mechanisms by which aerosols disperse and transmit in air and deposit onto surfaces. We then review the fundamental mechanisms that govern regional deposition of micro- and nanoparticles in the lung. Focus is given to biophysical interactions between particles and the pulmonary surfactant film, the initial alveolar-capillary barrier and first-line host defense system against inhaled particles and pathogens. Finally, we summarize the current understanding about the structural dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its interactions with receptors at the atomistic and molecular scales, primarily as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. This review provides urgent and multidisciplinary knowledge toward understanding the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its health impact on the respiratory system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33229999 | Organizational Health Literacy: Opportunities for Patient-Centered Care in the Wake of COVID-19.                                                                                                                    | The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is transforming the health care sector. As health care organizations move from crisis mobilization to a new landscape of health and social needs, organizational health literacy offers practical building blocks to provide high-quality, efficient, and meaningful care to patients and their families. Organizational health literacy is defined by the Institute of Medicine as ‚Äúthe degree to which an organization implements policies, practices, and systems that make it easier for people to navigate, understand, and use information and services to take care of their health.‚Äù This article synthesizes insights from organizational health literacy in the context of current major health care challenges and toward the goal of innovation in patient-centered care. We first provide a brief overview of the origins and outlines of organizational health literacy research and practice. Second, using an established patient-centered innovation framework, we show how the existing work on organizational health literacy can offer a menu of effective, patient-centered innovative options for care delivery systems to improve systems and outcomes. Finally, we consider the high value of management focusing on organizational health literacy efforts, specifically for patients in health care transitions and in the rapid transformation of care into myriad distance modalities. This article provides practical guidance for systems and informs decisions around resource allocation and organizational priorities to best meet the needs of patient populations even in the face of financial and workforce disruption. Organizational health literacy principles and guidelines provide a road map for promoting patient-centered care even in this time of crisis, change, and transformation. Health system leaders seeking innovative approaches can have access to well-established tool kits, guiding models, and materials toward many organizational health literacy goals across treatment, diagnosis, prevention, education, research, and outreach.

The United States has been severely affected, accounting for the most COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide. Without a coordinated national public health plan informed by surveillance with actionable metrics, the United States has been ineffective at preventing and mitigating the escalating COVID-19 pandemic. Existing surveillance has incomplete ascertainment and is limited by the use of standard surveillance metrics. Although many COVID-19 data sources track infection rates, informing prevention requires capturing the relevant dynamics of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to develop dynamic metrics for public health surveillance that can inform worldwide COVID-19 prevention efforts. Advanced surveillance techniques are essential to inform public health decision making and to identify where and when corrective action is required to prevent outbreaks. Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted COVID-19 data from global public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure daily case numbers for our use case in 50 US states and the District of Colombia as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. Examination of the United States and state data demonstrated that most US states are experiencing outbreaks as measured by these new metrics of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. Larger US states have high COVID-19 caseloads as a function of population size, density, and deficits in adherence to public health guidelines early in the epidemic, and other states have alarming rates of speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence in novel infections. North and South Dakota have had the highest rates of COVID-19 transmission combined with positive acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence. Wisconsin and Illinois also have alarming indicators and already lead the nation in daily new COVID-19 infections. As the United States enters its third wave of COVID-19, all 50 states and the District of Colombia have positive rates of speed between 7.58 (Hawaii) and 175.01 (North Dakota), and persistence, ranging from 4.44 (Vermont) to 195.35 (North Dakota) new infections per 100,000 people. Standard surveillance techniques such as daily and cumulative infections and deaths are helpful but only provide a static view of what has already occurred in the pandemic and are less helpful in prevention. Public health policy that is informed by dynamic surveillance can shift the country from reacting to COVID-19 transmissions to being proactive and taking corrective action when indicators of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence remain positive week over week. Implicit within our dynamic surveillance is an early warning system that indicates when there is problematic growth in COVID-19 transmissions as well as signals when growth will become explosive without action. A public health approach that focuses on prevention can prevent major outbreaks in addition to endorsing effective public health policies. Moreover, subnational analyses on the dynamics of the pandemic allow us to zero in on where transmissions are increasing, meaning corrective action can be applied with precision in problematic areas. Dynamic public health surveillance can inform specific geographies where quarantines are necessary while preserving the economy in other US areas. ¬©Lori Ann Post, Tariq Ziad Issa, Michael J Boctor, Charles B Moss, Robert L Murphy, Michael G Ison, Chad J Achenbach, Danielle Resnick, Lauren Nadya Singh, Janine White, Joshua Marco Mitchell Faber, Kasen Culler, Cynthia A Brandt, James Francis Oehmke.

The highly contagious nature of this respiratory virus has spurred massive global efforts to develop vaccines at record speeds. In addition to enhanced immunogen delivery, adjuvants may greatly impact protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To investigate adjuvant suitability, we formulated protein subunit vaccines consisting of the recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alone or in combination with either CoVaccine HT‚Ñ¢ or Alhydrogel. CoVaccine HT‚Ñ¢ induced high titres of antigen-binding IgG after a single dose, facilitated affinity maturation and class switching to a greater extent than Alhydrogel and elicited potent cell-mediated immunity as well as virus neutralizing antibody titres. Data presented here suggests that adjuvantation with CoVaccine HT‚Ñ¢ can rapidly induce a comprehensive and protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

| 33186704 | CCR5 inhibition in critical COVID-19 patients decreases inflammatory cytokines, increases CD8 T-cells, and decreases SARS-CoV2 RNA in plasma by day 14.                                                             | Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global pandemic. Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response. Given the role of CCR5 in immune cell migration and inflammation, we investigated the impact of CCR5 blockade via the CCR5-specific antibody leronlimab on clinical, immunological, and virological parameters in severe COVID-19 patients. In March 2020, 10 terminally ill, critical COVID-19 patients received two doses of leronlimab via individual emergency use indication. We analyzed changes in clinical presentation, immune cell populations, inflammation, as well as SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia before and 14 days after treatment. Over the 14-day study period, six patients survived, two were extubated, and one discharged. We observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy in all donors by day 7. Compared with the baseline, we observed a concomitant statistically significant reduction in plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and resolution of SARS-CoV2 plasma viremia (pVL). Furthermore, the increase in the CD8 percentage was inversely correlated with the reduction in pVL (r = -0.77, p = 0.0013). Our study design precludes clinical efficacy inferences but the results implicate CCR5 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19 and they form the basis for ongoing randomized clinical trials.

| 33176077 | An Outbreak of Covid-19 on an Aircraft Carrier.                                                                                                                                                                     | An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurred on the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a crew of 4779 personnel. We obtained clinical and demographic data for all crew members, including results of testing by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). All crew members were followed up for a minimum of 10 weeks, regardless of test results or the absence of symptoms. The crew was predominantly young (mean age, 27 years) and was in general good health, meeting U.S. Navy standards for sea duty. Over the course of the outbreak, 1271 crew members (26.6% of the crew) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by rRT-PCR testing, and more than 1000 infections were identified within 5 weeks after the first laboratory-confirmed infection. An additional 60 crew members had suspected Covid-19 (i.e., illness that met Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists clinical criteria for Covid-19 without a positive test result). Among the crew members with laboratory-confirmed infection, 76.9% (978 of 1271) had no symptoms at the time that they tested positive and 55.0% had symptoms develop at any time during the clinical course. Among the 1331 crew members with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, 23 (1.7%) were hospitalized, 4 (0.3%) received intensive care, and 1 died. Crew members who worked in confined spaces appeared more likely to become infected. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly among the crew of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Transmission was facilitated by close-quarters conditions and by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected crew members. Nearly half of those who tested positive for the virus never had symptoms.

| 33098971 | Medicine in motion: Opportunities, challenges and data analytics-based solutions for traditional medicine integration into western medical practice.                                                                | Traditional pharmacopeias have been developed by multiple cultures and evaluated for efficacy and safety through both historical/empirical iteration and more recently through controlled studies using Western scientific paradigms and an increasing emphasis on data science methodologies for network pharmacology. Traditional medicines represent likely sources of relatively inexpensive drugs for symptomatic management as well as potential libraries of new therapeutic approaches. Leveraging this potential requires hard evidence for efficacy that separates science from pseudoscience. We performed a review of non-Western medical systems and developed case studies that illustrate the epistemological and practical translative barriers that hamper their transition to integration with Western approaches. We developed a new data analytics approach, in silico convergence analysis, to deconvolve modes of action, and potentially predict desirable components of TM-derived formulations based on computational consensus analysis across cultures and medical systems. Abstraction, simplification and altered dose and delivery modalities were identified as factors that influence actual and perceived efficacy once a medicine is moved from a non-Western to Western setting. Case studies on these factors highlighted issues with translation between non-Western and Western epistemologies, including those where epistemological and medicinal systems drive markets that can be epicenters for zoonoses such as the novel Coronavirus. The proposed novel data science approach demonstrated the ability to identify and predict desirable medicinal components for a test indication, pain. Relegation of traditional therapies to the relatively unregulated nutraceutical industry may lead healthcare providers and patients to underestimate the therapeutic potential of these medicines. We suggest three areas of emphasis for this field: First, vertical integration and embedding of traditional medicines into healthcare systems would subject them to appropriate regulation and evidence-based practice, as viable integrative implementation mode. Second, we offer a new Bradford-Hill-like framework for setting research priorities and evaluating efficacy, with the goal of rescuing potentially valuable therapies from the nutraceutical market and discrediting those that are pseudoscience. Third, data analytics pipelines offer new capacity to generate new types of TMS-inspired medicines that are rationally-designed based on integrated knowledge across cultures, and also provide an evaluative framework against which to test claims of fidelity and efficacy to TMS made for nutraceuticals.

| 33083826 | Associations Between Genetically Predicted Protein Levels and COVID-19 Severity.                                                                                                                                    | It is critical to identify potential causal targets for SARS-CoV-2, which may guide drug repurposing options. We assessed the associations between genetically predicted protein levels and COVID-19 severity. Leveraging data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative comparing 6492 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 1 012 809 controls, we identified 18 proteins with genetically predicted levels to be associated with COVID-19 severity at a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05, including 12 that showed an association even after Bonferroni correction.

| 32984015 | Perspective: Cancer Patient Management Challenges During the COVID-19 Pandemic.                                                                                                                                     | On March 11, 2020, the WHO has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic. As the last few months have profoundly changed the delivery of health care in the world, we should recognize the effort of numerous comprehensive cancer centers to share experiences and knowledge to develop best practices to care for oncological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients as well as physicians must be aware of all these constraints and profound social, personal, and medical challenges posed by the tackling of this deadly disease in everyday life in order to adjust to such a completely novel scenario.

| 32921878 | Will COVID-19 be one shock too many for smallholder coffee livelihoods?                                                                                                                                             | Coffee supports the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers in more than 52 countries, and generates billions of dollars in revenue. The threats that COVID-19 pose to the global coffee sector is daunting with profound implications for coffee production. The financial impacts will be long-lived and uneven, and smallholders will be among the hardest hit. We argue that the impacts are rooted in the systemic vulnerability of the coffee production system and the unequal ways the sector is organized: Large revenues from the sale of coffee in the Global North are made possible by mostly impoverished smallholders in the Global South. COVID-19 will accentuate the existing vulnerabilities and create new ones, forcing many smallholders into alternative livelihoods. This outcome, however, is not inevitable. COVID-19 presents an opportunity to rebalance the system that currently creates large profits on one end of the supply chain and great vulnerability on the other. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.¬†All rights reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 32914093 | Public Compliance with Face Mask Use in Honolulu and Regional Variation.                                                                                                                                            | Infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus are increasing in Hawai‚Äôi at alarming rates. In the absence of a SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, the options for control include social distancing, improved hygiene, and face mask use. There is evidence that mask use may decrease the rates of viral transmission. The rate of effective face mask use has not yet been established in Hawai‚Äôi. The authors performed an observational study at 2 locations in Honolulu and evaluated outdoor face mask use compliance in 200 people. Simultaneous observations were performed in a downtown Honolulu business area and in Waikiki, an area focusing on tourism. Overall, 77% of all subjects used face masks in an appropriate fashion, covering their nose and mouth, while 23% were either incorrectly masked or not masked. The rate of compliance with correct public mask use in downtown Honolulu (88%) was significantly higher than in Waikiki (66%) (P=.0003, Odds Ratio \[95% Confidence Interval\]=3.78 \[1.82, 7.85\]) These findings suggest that there are opportunities for improvement in rates of public face mask use and a potential decrease in the spread of COVID-19 in our population. Four proposed actions are suggested, including a reassessment of the face mask exemption requirements, enhanced mask compliance education, non-threatening communication for non-compliance, and centralization of information of the public compliance with face mask use. ¬©Copyright 2020 by University Health Partners of Hawai‚Äòi (UHP Hawai‚Äòi).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Prediction and severity ratings of COVID-19 are essential for pandemic control and economic reopening in the United States. In this study, we apply the logistic and Gompertz model to evaluate possible turning points of the COVID-19 pandemic in different regions. By combining uncertainty and severity factors, this study constructed an indicator to assess the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in various states. Based on the index of severity ratings, different regions of the United States are classified into 4 categories. The result shows that it is possible to identify the first turning point in Montana and Hawaii. It is unclear when the rest of the states will reach the first peak. However, it can be inferred that 75% of regions will not reach the first peak of coronavirus before August 2, 2020. It is still essential for the majority of states to take proactive steps to fight against COVID-19 before August 2, 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 32891785 | National Psoriasis Foundation COVID-19 Task Force Guidance for Management of Psoriatic Disease During the Pandemic: Version 1.                                                                                      | To provide guidance about management of psoriatic disease during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A task force (TF) of 18 physician voting members with expertise in dermatology, rheumatology, epidemiology, infectious diseases, and critical care was convened. The TF was supplemented by nonvoting members, which included fellows and National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) staff. Clinical questions relevant to the psoriatic disease community were informed by questions received by the NPF. A Delphi process was conducted. The TF approved 22 guidance statements. The average of the votes was within the category of agreement for all statements. All guidance statements proposed were recommended, 9 with high consensus and 13 with moderate consensus. The evidence behind many guidance statements is limited in quality. These statements provide guidance for the management of patients with psoriatic disease on topics ranging from how the disease and its treatments impact COVID-19 risk and outcome, how medical care can be optimized during the pandemic, what patients should do to lower their risk of getting infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and what they should do if they develop COVID-19. The guidance is intended to be a living document that will be updated by the TF as data emerge.

| 32888905 | Saliva is a reliable, non-invasive specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection.                                                                                                                                               | Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) of respiratory specimens is the gold standard test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting nasopharyngeal swabs causes discomfort to patients and may represent considerable risk for healthcare workers. The use of saliva as a diagnostic sample has several advantages. The aim of this study was to validate the use of saliva as a biological sample for diagnosis of COVID-19. This study was conducted at Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory (LAPI), in Salvador, Brazil. Participants presenting with signs/symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and/or oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and saliva collection. Saliva samples were diluted in PBS, followed by RNA isolation and RT-Real Time PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results of conventional vs saliva samples testing were compared. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS) version 18.0. One hundred fifty-five participants were recruited and samples pairs of NPS/OPS and saliva were collected. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR using saliva samples were 94.4% (95% CI 86.4-97.8) and 97.62% (95% CI 91.7-99.3), respectively. There was an overall high agreement (96.1%) between the two tests. Use of self-collected saliva samples is an easy, convenient, and low-cost alternative to conventional NP swab-based molecular tests. These results may allow a broader use of molecular tests for management of COVID19 pandemic, especially in resources-limited settings. Copyright ¬© 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

| 32881116 | Delivering Prolonged Exposure Therapy via Videoconferencing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Overview of the Research and Special Considerations for Providers.                                                     | Leveraging technology to provide evidence-based therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as prolonged exposure (PE), during the COVID-19 pandemic helps ensure continued access to first-line PTSD treatment. Clinical video teleconferencing (CVT) technology can be used to effectively deliver PE while reducing the risk of COVID-19 exposure during the pandemic for both providers and patients. However, provider knowledge, experience, and comfort level with delivering mental health care services, such as PE, via CVT is critical to ensure a smooth, safe, and effective transition to virtual care. Further, some of the limitations associated with the pandemic, including stay-at-home orders and physical distancing, require that providers become adept at applying principles of exposure therapy with more flexibility and creativity, such as when assigning in vivo exposures. The present paper provides the rationale and guidelines for implementing PE via CVT during COVID-19 and includes practical suggestions and clinical recommendations. Published 2020.

| 32837709 | Comparison of Telehealth-Related Ethics and Guidelines and a Checklist for Ethical Decision Making in the Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic.                                                                           | Applied behavior analysis (ABA) services have been provided primarily in the fields of health care and education across various settings using an in-person service delivery model. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity of and demand for ABA services using telehealth have increased. The purpose of the present article was to cross-examine the ethical codes and guidelines of different, but related fields of practice and to discuss potential implications for telehealth-based ABA service delivery. We reviewed the telehealth-specific ethical codes and guidelines of the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the National Association of Social Workers, along with the related ABA literature. These organizations addressed several useful and unique ethical concerns that have not been addressed in ABA literature. We also developed a brief checklist for ABA practitioners to evaluate their telehealth readiness by meeting the legal, professional, and ethical requirements of ABA services. ¬© Association for Behavior Analysis International 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

An association has also been reported with bacterial and viral respiratory infections. Herein, we report the first case of ReA after the he severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This male patient is in his 50s who was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. On the second day of admission, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive from nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Despite starting standard dose of favipiravir, his respiratory condition deteriorated during hospitalisation. On the fourth hospital day, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and was intubated. On day 11, he was successfully extubated, subsequently completing a 14-day course of favipiravir. On day 21, 1 day after starting physical therapy, he developed acute bilateral arthritis in his ankles, with mild enthesitis in his right Achilles tendon, without rash, conjunctivitis, or preceding diarrhoea or urethritis. Arthrocentesis of his left ankle revealed mild inflammatory fluid without monosodium urate or calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Culture of synovial fluid was negative. Plain X-rays of his ankles and feet showed no erosive changes or enthesophytes. Tests for syphilis, HIV, anti-streptolysin O (ASO), Mycoplasma, Chlamydia pneumoniae, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and Human Leukocyte Antigen-B27 (HLA-B27) were negative. Gonococcal and Chlamydia trachomatis urine PCR were also negative. He was diagnosed with ReA.

| 32763350 | 3D printing of face shields to meet the immediate need for PPE in an anesthesiology department during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                                                        | Anesthesia providers are at risk for contracting COVID-19 due to close patient contact, especially during shortages of personal protective equipment. We present an easy to follow and detailed protocol for producing 3D printed face shields and an effective decontamination protocol, allowing their reuse. The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) produced face shields using a combination of 3D printing and assembly with commonly available products, and produced a simple decontamination protocol to allow their reuse. To evaluate the effectiveness of the decontamination protocol, we inoculated bacterial suspensions of E. coli and S. aureus on to the face shield components, performed the decontamination procedure, and finally swabbed and enumerated organisms onto plates that were incubated for 12-24 hours. Decontamination effectiveness was evaluated using the average log10 reduction in colony counts. Approximately 112 face shields were constructed and made available for use in 72 hours. These methods were successfully implemented for in-house production at UNMC and at Tripler Army Medical Center (Honolulu, Hawaii). Overall, the decontamination protocol was highly effective against both E. coli and S. aureus, achieving a ‚â•4 log10 (99.99%) reduction in colony counts for every replicate from each component of the face shield unit. Face shields not only act as a barrier against the soiling of N95 face masks, they also serve as more effective eye protection from respiratory droplets over standard eye shields. Implementation of decontamination protocols successfully allowed face shield and N95 mask reuse, offering a higher level of protection for anesthesiology providers at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a time of urgent need, our protocol enabled the rapid production of face shields by individuals with little to no 3D printing experience, and provided a simple and effective decontamination protocol allowing reuse of the face shields.

| 32745072 | Obstetric hospital preparedness for a pandemic: an obstetric critical care perspective in response to COVID-19.                                                                                                     | The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had a rapid and deadly onset, spreading quickly throughout the world. Pregnant patients have had high mortality rates, perinatal losses, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions from acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the past. Potentially, a surge of patients may require hospitalization and ICU care beyond the capacity of the health care system. This article is to provide institutional guidance on how to prepare an obstetric hospital service for a pandemic, mass casualty, or natural disaster by identifying a care model and resources for a large surge of critically ill pregnant patients over a short time. We recommend a series of protocols, education, and simulation training, with a structured and tiered approach to match the needs for the patients, for hospitals specialized in obstetrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 32692706 | Academic clinical learning environment in obstetrics and gynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic: responses and lessons learned.                                                                                    | COVID-19 pandemic is changing profoundly the obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) academic clinical learning environment in many different ways. Rapid developments affecting our learners, patients, faculty and staff require unprecedented collaboration and quick, deeply consequential readjustments, almost on a daily basis. We summarized here our experiences, opportunities, challenges and lessons learned and outline how to move forward. The COVID-19 pandemic taught us there is a clear need for collaboration in implementing the most current evidence-based medicine, rapidly assess and improve the everchanging healthcare environment by problem solving and ‚Äúhow to‚Äù instead of ‚Äúshould we‚Äù approach. In addition, as a community with very limited resources we have to rely heavily on internal expertise, ingenuity and innovation. The key points to succeed are efficient and timely communication, transparency in decision making and reengagement. As time continues to pass, it is certain that more lessons will emerge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Early projections of international spread influenced travel restrictions and border closures. Model projections based on the virus‚Äôs infectiousness demonstrated its pandemic potential, which guided the global response to and prepared countries for increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Tracking the impact of distancing and movement policies and behaviour changes has been critical in evaluating these decisions. Models have provided insights into the epidemiological differences between higher and lower income countries, as well as vulnerable population groups within countries to help design fit-for-purpose policies. Economic evaluation and policies have combined epidemic models and traditional economic models to address the economic consequences of COVID-19, which have informed policy calls for easing restrictions. Social contact and mobility models have allowed evaluation of the pathways to safely relax mobility restrictions and distancing measures. Finally, models can consider future end-game scenarios, including how suppression can be achieved and the impact of different vaccination strategies. Copyright ¬© 2020.

Response to this ongoing pandemic requires extensive collaboration across the scientific community in an attempt to contain its impact and limit further transmission. Mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of these response efforts by: (1) providing initial estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction rate, R0 (of approximately 2-3); (2) updating these estimates following the implementation of various interventions (with significantly reduced, often sub-critical, transmission rates); (3) assessing the potential for global spread before significant case numbers had been reported internationally; and (4) quantifying the expected disease severity and burden of COVID-19, indicating that the likely true infection rate is often orders of magnitude greater than estimates based on confirmed case counts alone. In this review, we highlight the critical role played by mathematical modelling to understand COVID-19 thus far, the challenges posed by data availability and uncertainty, and the continuing utility of modelling-based approaches to guide decision making and inform the public health response. ‚Ä†Unless otherwise stated, all bracketed error margins correspond to the 95% credible interval (CrI) for reported estimates.

| 32649272 | Combating COVID-19 and Building Immune Resilience: A Potential Role for Magnesium Nutrition?                                                                                                                        | Background: In December 2019, the viral pandemic of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 began sweeping its way across the globe. Several aspects of this infectious disease mimic metabolic events shown to occur during latent subclinical magnesium deficiency. Hypomagnesemia is a relatively common clinical occurrence that often goes unrecognized since magnesium levels are rarely monitored in the clinical setting. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation after potassium. It is involved in &gt;600 enzymatic reactions in the body, including those contributing to the exaggerated immune and inflammatory responses exhibited by COVID-19 patients.Methods: A summary of experimental findings and knowledge of the biochemical role magnesium may play in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is presented in this perspective. The National Academy of Medicine‚Äôs Standards for Systematic Reviews were independently employed to identify clinical and prospective cohort studies assessing the relationship of magnesium with interleukin-6, a prominent drug target for treating COVID-19.Results: Clinical recommendations are given for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Constant monitoring of ionized magnesium status with subsequent repletion, when appropriate, may be an effective strategy to influence disease contraction and progression. The peer-reviewed literature supports that several aspects of magnesium nutrition warrant clinical consideration. Mechanisms include its ‚Äúcalcium-channel blocking‚Äù effects that lead to downstream suppression of nuclear factor-KŒ≤, interleukin-6, c-reactive protein, and other related endocrine disrupters; its role in regulating renal potassium loss; and its ability to activate and enhance the functionality of vitamin D, among others.Conclusion: As the world awaits an effective vaccine, nutrition plays an important and safe role in helping mitigate patient morbidity and mortality.

| 32462545 | Treatments Administered to the First 9152 Reported Cases of COVID-19: A Systematic Review.                                                                                                                          | The emergence of SARS-CoV-2/2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has created a global pandemic with no approved treatments or vaccines. Many treatments have already been administered to COVID-19 patients but have not been systematically evaluated. We performed a systematic literature review to identify all treatments reported to be administered to COVID-19 patients and to assess time to clinically meaningful response for treatments with sufficient data. We searched PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv for articles reporting treatments for COVID-19 patients published between 1 December 2019 and 27 March 2020. Data were analyzed descriptively. Of the 2706 articles identified, 155 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 9152 patients. The cohort was 45.4% female and 98.3% hospitalized, and mean (SD) age was 44.4 years (SD 21.0). The most frequently administered drug classes were antivirals, antibiotics, and corticosteroids, and of the 115 reported drugs, the most frequently administered was combination lopinavir/ritonavir, which was associated with a time to clinically meaningful response (complete symptom resolution or hospital discharge) of 11.7 (1.09) days. There were insufficient data to compare across treatments. Many treatments have been administered to the first 9152 reported cases of COVID-19. These data serve as the basis for an open-source registry of all reported treatments given to COVID-19 patients at www.CDCN.org/CORONA . Further work is needed to prioritize drugs for investigation in well-controlled clinical trials and treatment protocols.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 32432219 | Insights in Public Health: COVID-19 Special Column: The Crisis of Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.                                                               | Globally, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is threatening human health and changing the way people live. With the increasing evidence showing comorbidities of COVID-19 and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the Pacific region, where approximately 75% of deaths are due to NCDs, is significantly vulnerable during this crisis unless urgent action is taken. Whilst enforcing the critical mitigation measures of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pacific, it is also paramount to incorporate and strengthen NCD prevention and control measures to safeguard people with NCDs and the general population; keep people healthy and minimise the impact of COVID-19. To sustain wellbeing of health, social relationships, and the economy in the Pacific, it is a critical time for all governments, development partners and civil societies to show regional solidarity in the fight against emerging COVID-19 health crisis and existing Pacific NCDs crisis through a whole of government and whole of society approach. ¬©Copyright 2020 by University Health Partners of Hawai‚Äòi (UHP Hawai‚Äòi).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

To date the FDA has given emergency use authorization (EUA) to 48 COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and 21 high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests, as well as implemented policies that give broad authority to clinical laboratories and commercial manufacturers in the development, distribution, and use of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Currently, there are 2 types of diagnostic tests available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: (1) molecular and (2) serological tests. Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen. Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual‚Äôs immune system. A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection. In this article, the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests currently approved by the FDA under EUA are reviewed, and other diagnostic tests that researchers are developing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed. ¬©Copyright 2020 by University Health Partners of Hawai‚Äòi (UHP Hawai‚Äòi).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 32420720 | Caring for Critically Ill Adults With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a PICU: Recommendations by Dual Trained Intensivists.                                                                                             | In the midst of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, which causes coronavirus disease 2019, there is a recognized need to expand critical care services and beds beyond the traditional boundaries. There is considerable concern that widespread infection will result in a surge of critically ill patients that will overwhelm our present adult ICU capacity. In this setting, one proposal to add ‚Äúsurge capacity‚Äù has been the use of PICU beds and physicians to care for these critically ill adults. Narrative review/perspective. Not applicable. Not applicable. None. The virus‚Äôs high infectivity and prolonged asymptomatic shedding have resulted in an exponential growth in the number of cases in the United States within the past weeks with many (up to 6%) developing acute respiratory distress syndrome mandating critical care services. Coronavirus disease 2019 critical illness appears to be primarily occurring in adults. Although pediatric intensivists are well versed in the care of acute respiratory distress syndrome from viral pneumonia, the care of differing aged adult populations presents some unique challenges. In this statement, a team of adult and pediatric-trained critical care physicians provides guidance on common ‚Äúadult‚Äù issues that may be encountered in the care of these patients and how they can best be managed in a PICU. This concise scientific statement includes references to the most recent and relevant guidelines and clinical trials that shape management decisions.

| 32386898 | Geospatial analysis of COVID-19 and otolaryngologists above age 60.                                                                                                                                                 | The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is disproportionately impacting older individuals and healthcare workers. Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads. This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan. Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.

Currently, the United States stands as the most affected country, and the entire healthcare system is affected, from emergency department, intensive care unit, postacute care, outpatient, to home care. Considering the debility, neurological, pulmonary, neuromuscular, and cognitive complications, rehabilitation professionals can play an important role in the recovery process for individuals with coronavirus disease 2019. Clinicians across the nation‚Äôs rehabilitation system have already begun working to initiate intensive care unit-based rehabilitation care and develop programs, settings, and specialized care to meet the short- and long-term needs of these individuals. We describe the anticipated rehabilitation demands and the strategies to meet the needs of this population. The complications from coronavirus disease 2019 can be reduced by (1) delivering interdisciplinary rehabilitation that is initiated early and continued throughout the acute hospital stay, (2) providing patient/family education for self-care after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation at either acute or subacute settings, and (3) continuing rehabilitation care in the outpatient setting and at home through ongoing therapy either in-person or via telehealth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to address this unprecedented crisis on behalf of the epidemiology research community. As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hot spots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors. The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae. We call upon additional epidemiology cohorts to join this collective effort to strengthen our impact on the current health crisis and generate a new model for a collaborative and nimble research infrastructure that will lead to more rapid translation of our work for the betterment of public health. ¬©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 32361738 | Risk Factors Associated With Clinical Outcomes in 323 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Hospitalized Patients in Wuhan, China.                                                                                    | With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into 3 disease severity groups (nonsevere, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes. By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate regression indicated age &gt;65 years (P &lt; .001), smoking (P = .001), critical disease status (P = .002), diabetes (P = .025), high hypersensitive troponin I (&gt;0.04 pg/mL, P = .02), leukocytosis (&gt;10 √ó 109/L, P &lt; .001), and neutrophilia (&gt;75 √ó 109/L, P &lt; .001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. In contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (P &lt; .001), which was confirmed by survival analysis. Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.

In addition to the considerable workload challenges, surgeons are faced with a number of uncertainties regarding their own safety, practice, and overall patient care. This guide has been drafted at short notice to advise on specific issues related to surgical service provision and the safety of minimally invasive surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although laparoscopy can theoretically lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, there is no evidence available to confirm this is the case with COVID-19. The ultimate decision on the approach should be made after considering the proven benefits of laparoscopic techniques versus the potential theoretical risks of aerosolization. Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties and all members of the OR staff should use personal protective equipment (PPE) in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status. Pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open. All emergent endoscopic procedures performed during the pandemic should be considered as high risk and PPE must be used by all endoscopy staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 32314954 | COVID-19 Community Stabilization and Sustainability Framework: An Integration of the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs and Social Determinants of Health.                                                                   | All levels of government are authorized to apply coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) protection measures; however, they must consider how and when to ease lockdown restrictions to limit long-term societal harm and societal instability. Leaders that use a well-considered framework with an incremental approach will be able to gradually restart society while simultaneously maintaining the public health benefits achieved through lockdown measures. Economically vulnerable populations cannot endure long-term lockdown, and most countries lack the ability to maintain a full nationwide relief operation. Decision-makers need to understand this risk and how the Maslow hierarchy of needs and the social determinants of health can guide whole of society policies. Aligning decisions with societal needs will help ensure all segments of society are catered to and met while managing the crisis. This must inform the process of incremental easing of lockdowns to facilitate the resumption of community foundations, such as commerce, education, and employment in a manner that protects those most vulnerable to COVID-19. This study proposes a framework for identifying a path forward. It reflects on baseline requirements, regulations and recommendations, triggers, and implementation. Those desiring a successful recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic need to adopt an evidence-based framework now to ensure community stabilization and sustainability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 32259247 | Pain Management Best Practices from Multispecialty Organizations During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Public Health Crises.                                                                                             | It is nearly impossible to overestimate the burden of chronic pain, which is associated with enormous personal and socioeconomic costs. Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in the world, is associated with multiple psychiatric comorbidities, and has been causally linked to the opioid crisis. Access to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous organizations. The current COVID-19 pandemic has strained medical resources, creating a dilemma for physicians charged with the responsibility to limit spread of the contagion and to treat the patients they are entrusted to care for. To address these issues, an expert panel was convened that included pain management experts from the military, Veterans Health Administration, and academia. Endorsement from stakeholder societies was sought upon completion of the document within a one-week period. In these guidelines, we provide a framework for pain practitioners and institutions to balance the often-conflicting goals of risk mitigation for health care providers, risk mitigation for patients, conservation of resources, and access to pain management services. Specific issues discussed include general and intervention-specific risk mitigation, patient flow issues and staffing plans, telemedicine options, triaging recommendations, strategies to reduce psychological sequelae in health care providers, and resource utilization. The COVID-19 public health crisis has strained health care systems, creating a conundrum for patients, pain medicine practitioners, hospital leaders, and regulatory officials. Although this document provides a framework for pain management services, systems-wide and individual decisions must take into account clinical considerations, regional health conditions, government and hospital directives, resource availability, and the welfare of health care providers.
